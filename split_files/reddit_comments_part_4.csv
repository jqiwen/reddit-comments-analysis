Trump’s new head of DOT rips up US fuel efficiency regulations | Secretary Duffy claims polluting more will make cars cheaper.,"There are some requirements particularly for pickups where automakers either need to make impossible fuel economy or pay a fee for each vehicle produced. This is primarily why pick ups are getting bigger and bigger as the larger the square footage they take up, the lower the EPA fuel economy target they are required to make. 

Elimination of those fees will make pickups cheaper, and they are generally a north american product.

The men saying they thought about a woman complimenting them likely have gotten positive reinforcement from a parent before. But they aren't getting it outside the home. The fact remains people as a whole are nice and friendly to people who appear safe and friendly to them. If women do not feel secure around you, they will not approach you, for a start. If you do not put yourself in situations where positive feedback is possible, you will not get any, either. If you are negative or aggressive, you will likely be avoided. 

These are men getting reinforcement that's not earned and not understanding no one without a biased interest is going to view them as the same kind of ""special"". There's 8 billion people in the world. No one is actually special. What you can be is the type of person people want to be around, however, in your community",

Alibaba releases AI model it says surpasses DeepSeek,"The paradox doesnt inherantly have to do with energy consumption, its about generalized demand, where the cost of a resource being used dropping causes demand to increase.

Release of open source models like Stable Diffusion made the practice far more common as people could run it on their own PCs. As more and more streamlined and distilled models reduced system requirments (especially VRAM counts) you saw it become even more common, to the point more websites could host them and eventually even be hosted locally on smartphones.

To be honest, JP wasn't exactly what I was getting at with that comment. Its moreso the actual optimizations made by Deepseek can also be applied to bigger models in the first place. So it's release could in the long term increase NVIDIA demand by both:

1) Letting more smaller groups host and train their own models.

OpenAI Claims DeepSeek Plagiarized. Its Plagiarism Machine.,"I'd be going a slightly different route to that, but you have the right conclusion. The use of copyrighted works in AI models is probably *not* copyright infringement—if it were, it'd imply that a lot of very reasonable things are. [Cory Doctorow says it well.](https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/13/spooky-action-at-a-close-up/) It comes down to the point that neither *facts* nor *styles* are copyrightable (and they absolutely *should not* be so).

If a model is trained on your work and then outputs something [substantially similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantial_similarity) to it, that's straightforward copyright infringement. If a model is trained on your work and produces something ""new"", though, it doesn't *matter* if it's using your work as a billionth of its dataset—it's essentially [*de minimis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_minimis) of any individual work, and very likely [fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) if not *de minimis*.

Where it's not okay is the part where an organization can draw from the commons of everyone's works and then privatize their generalization from that without giving anything back to that commons. So … Stable Diffusion models that they give away for free for anyone with a nice computer to run, supported by them selling easy cloud-based generation for the people without nice computers? That seems largely reasonable to me … okay, minus all the abuse by the incompetent and malicious. OpenAI models where they charge a hefty price tag for ongoing use and hoard the models?

Trump’s new head of DOT rips up US fuel efficiency regulations | Secretary Duffy claims polluting more will make cars cheaper.,"Idk the details of this (I am sure it has some other consequences from incompetence like much of Trump admin changes) but US regulation is why we have bigger cars/trucks then the rest of the world. Corporate Average Fuel Economy  [ CAFE] standards have a loophole for 'light trucks' which allows them to have a lower mpg average requirement then normal cars. This loophole was expanded during the bush era to tie mpg requirements to  a vehicle physical size. Basically the bigger the vehicle the lower the mpg requirement which resulted in Us car manufacturers building bigger cars to avoid mpg requirements.

Normally I would be on board with revising this regulation as it is not doing what it intended. Instead of focusing on building fuel efficient cars manufacturers focus on building bigger cars with lower mpg requirements meaning we are selling more less efficient vehicles. It needs a rework. 

Yet I don't trust this admin to do it correctly. If I understand correctly this basically removes regulations, it doesn't refactor them to be better. So now car manufacturers can sell both big and even less fuel efficient vehicles. My only hope here is that car manufacturers not really utilizing this as it is likely to revert back to being regulated the second Dems retake power (if that even happens :( )",

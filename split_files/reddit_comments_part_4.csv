Alibaba releases AI model it says surpasses DeepSeek,"The paradox doesnt inherantly have to do with energy consumption, its about generalized demand, where the cost of a resource being used dropping causes demand to increase. We've definitely see this with AI. Image generation was initially locked behind API calls with DALL-E. Release of open source models like Stable Diffusion made the practice far more common as people could run it on their own PCs. As more and more streamlined and distilled models reduced system requirments (especially VRAM counts) you saw it become even more common, to the point more websites could host them and eventually even be hosted locally on smartphones.

To be honest, JP wasn't exactly what I was getting at with that comment. Its moreso the actual optimizations made by Deepseek can also be applied to bigger models in the first place. So it's release could in the long term increase NVIDIA demand by both:

1) Letting more smaller groups host and train their own models.

"ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says",">To pretend the previous commenter is saying boys don't deserve positive reinforcement instead of calling out a very real double standard that negatively impacts everyone involved demonstrates either bad faith on your part or a lack of reading comprehension. 

I'd normally write this off as another person who doesn't understand the words they've heard smarter people use, but I'm waiting on my coffee so I'll give you the time.

So lets break it down.

>*At least the chat doesn't ignore them*

>*Might be their personality. Maybe a therapist would be a better use of their time.*

The original joke is met with the admonition that maybe those men deserve to be ignored. But it goes on:

>*There's too many men raised by ""boy moms"" and dads who dont think they need to ""raise"" children who told them how special they were*

Here we have the wedging of personal grievances. Which is fine, whatever, but it doesn't make sense. As I noted with my comment:

>*You'll notice basically all of them have some top level variation on ""a girl complimented me once and I've thought about it for the last 6 years.""*

Which is, generally speaking, not the behavior of a cohort that is being lathered in reinforcement and to whom life treats as a special prince.

Does that help?

To maybe scaffold the larger dialogue for you, the thing that both you and the other commenter are missing from the male experience (you are both women, I'm guessing?) is that you are confusing *apathy* for *favoritism*.

The world, largely, does not care about men; [certainly not when there is an opportunity to care about women instead](https://x.com/Try2StopME/status/1588727702932303873). Even parents are less protective of male children. The ""lack of parenting"" you are referring to may seem nice when as a child you are yourself being structured more (obviously the envy carries to this day) but another nearer word would be ""neglect."" And that doesn't end in childhood, it carries forward for our entire lives.",

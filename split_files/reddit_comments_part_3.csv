"ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says",Men as a whole are not bad. Some people are raised terribly and become bad because they do not have the drive to be a better person once on their own. A patriarchal society makes men the most notable example because they are the most visible and have more control in society. This is why people say toxic masculinity hurts men. Having some advantages in society does not translate to personal relationships and causes confusion,

And then China comes in and develops the same tech for pennies on the dollar vs US investors, literally only in the millions compared to hundreds of billions to trillions for US investors.

They're screwed...big tech is screwed...it's a massive bubble waiting to pop. You're (investors) never getting a return on that trillion dollar investment, lol.

"Chinese firms ‘distilling’ US AI models to create rival products, warns OpenAI","I'm tired of the narrative/ propaganda being pushed. So OpenAI is furious that someone released an actual *Open AI* that significantly is better than them performance wise and cost wise? Based from what I understand, the newer model requires less powerful GPUs to train/ run, lowering the barrier for to entry for people interested in AI stuff.

To further humiliate them, the project is open source and released by China of all places. You don't like that the model is spitting out gov psyop or some backdoor in the code? The code is public! Go to github, clone the project, inspect the code, and maybe retrain it. The project is open source.

Also afaik, using the output of a model as training data is common practice in machine learning, so idk what's the big deal here.

Moreover, Open AI, a non profit that plans to turn into a for profit with ties to the military industrial complex, trained their model on copyrighted materials that may have been without consent. So uhm, they're whining someone did the same thing to them? I find the hypocrisy amusing

In the end, I think Deepseek is an overall good thing for the everyday consumer, and I hope that this will pop the AI bubble

Manipulation from Abroad: German Election Campaign Flooded with Fake News and Videos,"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz allegedly has one. So, too, does Green Party co-chair Franziska Brantner. A multi-million-dollar villa in California.

Scholz, according to the narrative, owns a choice estate in the Hollywood Hills – or did, at least, until it was burned down in the fires. That, at least, was the claim espoused by a recent video, complete with aerial shots of a spectacular mansion.

Many videos currently circulating on social media channels, particularly TikTok, are reinforcing a popular cliché: namely that those at the top earn millions and betray the interests of ordinary people.

The problem, though, is that the videos are complete and utter fabrications.

Russian-Produced Fakes On Elon Musk’s channel X, a clip is circulating showing a uniformed police officer who introduces himself as Cameron. He says he is happy he works in the United Kingdom and not in Germany. According to information received by his agency, he says, a series of major terrorist attacks are being prepared in Germany during the country’s snap parliamentary elections in February. ""Share this video with your friends and family,"" he says.

This video, too, is a fake, likely produced in Russia. The creators took clips from real videos and, as the activists from the fake-news awareness group Antibot4Navalny learned, then used artificial intelligence to distort the voices.

The internet is currently full of countless other manipulations, all with a single goal: to trigger chaos and uncertainty ahead of German elections in an effort to strengthen the political fringes.

  
The attacks aren’t just coming from the east, but also from the west, from the U.S., the erstwhile beacon of freedom and democracy. Elon Musk, the wealthiest man in the world and the owner of both X and Tesla, a man who has developed an almost manic interest in German politics of late, has become a new heavyweight distributor of disinformation. He recently livestreamed a bizarre discussion on X with Alice Weidel, the head of the radical right-wing party Alternative for Germany (AfD) and has repeatedly encouraged voters to back extremist parties. He has also used X to disseminate conspiracy theories designed to boost the fortunes of right-wing populist and right-wing extremist parties around the world",

Headed for technofascism’: the rightwing roots of Silicon Valley,"Some offshoots of this is that 

(1) education is most important as you need the most disaggregated and best information processing systems amongst your society
(2) democracy is important to allow disaggregated information handling for decision purposes 
(3) free markets and anti-monopolies are another form of protecting economic information systems. Insomuch as more economic resources are consolidated to a few corporates - the information system breaks down 
(4) respecting differing views is important because group think or loudly overshadowing other view again destroys the information system
(5) utilizing psychological tactics to corrupt individuals thought processes becomes counter productive as it again removes freedom of thought and processing within that system. 

I often note that even a philosopher king would fail because once a system becomes too limited in information gathering and processing - it becomes harder and harder to manage chaotic systems.

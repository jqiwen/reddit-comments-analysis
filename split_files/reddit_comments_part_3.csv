OpenAI Claims DeepSeek Plagiarized. Its Plagiarism Machine.,"I'd be going a slightly different route to that, but you have the right conclusion. The use of copyrighted works in AI models is probably *not* copyright infringement—if it were, it'd imply that a lot of very reasonable things are. [Cory Doctorow says it well.](https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/13/spooky-action-at-a-close-up/) It comes down to the point that neither *facts* nor *styles* are copyrightable (and they absolutely *should not* be so).

If a model is trained on your work and then outputs something [substantially similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantial_similarity) to it, that's straightforward copyright infringement. If a model is trained on your work and produces something ""new"", though, it doesn't *matter* if it's using your work as a billionth of its dataset—it's essentially [*de minimis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_minimis) of any individual work, and very likely [fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) if not *de minimis*.

Where it's not okay is the part where an organization can draw from the commons of everyone's works and then privatize their generalization from that without giving anything back to that commons. So … Stable Diffusion models that they give away for free for anyone with a nice computer to run, supported by them selling easy cloud-based generation for the people without nice computers? That seems largely reasonable to me … okay, minus all the abuse by the incompetent and malicious. OpenAI models where they charge a hefty price tag for ongoing use and hoard the models? Not okay, plus has the *same* problem of use by idiots.",

Can designing be made more appealing to women later on? Probably. But this won't compensate for the deep-seated, instinctive drivers that steer men in this direction from early childhood—at least not on a societal level.

Reliance on AI goes beyond just you and our peers, it trickles down to our youth. 

Children in this age are already suffering from slower development. It's made worse by the fact that they're increasingly using AI to think for them, and are using it for homework or essays etc... and more often than you suggest the AI spouts out incorrect information. It should not replace children's brains or yours. It's a tool and its opinions are worth a grain of salt.",

"ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says","There's such a thing as toxic positivity. They get reinforcement from one biased source and cannot comprehend why others do not follow suit. Because the source down plays negative aspects of their personality, they assume they are ""fine"" without acknowledging what is stopping others from giving them attention and positivity 

The men saying they thought about a woman complimenting them likely have gotten positive reinforcement from a parent before. But they aren't getting it outside the home. The fact remains people as a whole are nice and friendly to people who appear safe and friendly to them. If women do not feel secure around you, they will not approach you, for a start. If you do not put yourself in situations where positive feedback is possible, you will not get any, either. If you are negative or aggressive, you will likely be avoided. 

These are men getting reinforcement that's not earned and not understanding no one without a biased interest is going to view them as the same kind of ""special"". There's 8 billion people in the world. No one is actually special. What you can be is the type of person people want to be around, however, in your community",

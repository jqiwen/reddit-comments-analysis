Google has always used publicly available data to create their most valuable asset: their search index. 

Here’s what the memo actually says are “potential” issues:

• Using AI to “foster or advance deception.”

>California’s memo makes clear that companies that use AI to create “deepfakes, chatbots, and voice clones that appear to represent people, events, and utterances that never existed” could fall under the category of “deceptive” and, thus, be considered a breach of state law.

• Falsely advertising “the accuracy, quality, or utility of AI systems.”

>…companies should refrain from “claiming that an AI system has a capability that it does not; representing that a system is completely powered by AI when humans are responsible for performing some of its functions; representing that humans are responsible for performing some of a system’s functions when AI is responsible instead; or claiming without basis that a system is accurate, performs tasks better than a human would, has specified characteristics, meets industry or other standards, or is free from bias.

•Create or sell an AI system or product that has “an adverse or disproportionate impact on members of a protected class, or create, reinforce, or perpetuate discrimination or segregation of members of a protected class.“

They absolutely already do this. More often than you think.

And it's not just cars, its also motorcycles.

A good example is the CA/CARB version of Harley vs the rest of the 49States version of the bike. the CA/CARB version has emissions hardware and different tunes and stuff like that to meet CARB.

The rest of the same model sold elsewhere/outside the EU will not have this hardware. Instead they have more aggressive tunes and simply do not install the emissions control(except the Cat converter). Despite this the bikes are still actually Euro5 compliant and are really clean engines.

This is not unique to HD and pretty much everyone does it because Cali's economy is so big and powerful and worth selling in.

There are literally millions of cars in the USA and bikes too, that could not be sold in California but can still be sold in Europe(euro5 compliant).",

Generally speaking: If US products are no longer fit for the global market, smaller production numbers inevitably lead to higher prices. (Example: Cybertruck will never be allowed to be broadly legal in Europe because it's just too perfectly designed to kill pedestrians.)

Also disincentivizes innovation – making the industry less competitive over time. And then once the next administration reinstates these common sense regulations... the industry will have fallen behind.

UNLESS of course the industry chooses to ignore this change in order to not fall behind. But then... no car gets cheaper *either*.

This will have a very temporary effect on prices at best– not a sustainable one. It's ~~smoke~~ exhaust fumes and mirrors.",

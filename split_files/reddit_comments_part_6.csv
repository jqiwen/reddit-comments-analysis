Trump’s new head of DOT rips up US fuel efficiency regulations | Secretary Duffy claims polluting more will make cars cheaper.,"It's an old Russian political trick. Hire a grossly incompetent person into role X, and they will always do what you tell them because you both know they are replacable. It encourages personal loyalty but completely disregards competence. 

The real problem is that most states - particularly industrial states - have environmental regulations and on the ground rules and such, so even if you remove federal regulation Car companies that want to sell into California, Texas, New York need to hit a common standard, so you build to whatever the most stringent regulation is because you're spending billions or tens of billions in engineering and manufacturing development costs.

So Donald Trump can shit on every federal regulation and is still fucked by the fact that 50 states have a potpourri of regulations and suddenly it's a population over law problem, New York, California, Florida, Texas, Illinois and Ohio laws dominate the conversation and only two of them are entirely on board with the stupidity.",

AI haters build tarpits to trap and trick AI scrapers that ignore robots.txt | Attackers explain how an anti-spam defense became an AI weapon,"Some of the more interesting highlights:

>Shortly after he noticed Facebook's crawler exceeding 30 million hits on his site, Aaron began plotting a new kind of attack on crawlers ""clobbering"" websites that he told Ars he hoped would give ""teeth"" to robots.txt.
>
>Building on an anti-spam cybersecurity tactic known as tarpitting, he created Nepenthes, malicious software named after a carnivorous plant that will ""eat just about anything that finds its way inside.""
>
>Aaron clearly warns users that Nepenthes is aggressive malware. It's not to be deployed by site owners uncomfortable with trapping AI crawlers and sending them down an ""infinite maze"" of static files with no exit links, where they ""get stuck"" and ""thrash around"" for months, he tells users. Once trapped, the crawlers can be fed gibberish data, aka Markov babble, which is designed to poison AI models. That's likely an appealing bonus feature for any site owners who, like Aaron, are fed up with paying for AI scraping and just want to watch AI burn.
>
>Tarpits were originally designed to waste spammers' time and resources, but creators like Aaron have now evolved the tactic into an anti-AI weapon. As of this writing, Aaron confirmed that Nepenthes can effectively trap all the major web crawlers. So far, only OpenAI's crawler has managed to escape.
>
>...
>
>""We’re aware of efforts to disrupt AI web crawlers,"" OpenAI's spokesperson said. ""We design our systems to be resilient while respecting robots.txt and standard web practices.""
>
>But to Aaron, the fight is not about winning. Instead, it's about resisting the AI industry further decaying the Internet with tech that no one asked for, like chatbots that replace customer service agents or the rise of inaccurate AI search summaries. By releasing Nepenthes, he hopes to do as much damage as possible, perhaps spiking companies' AI training costs, dragging out training efforts, or even accelerating model collapse, with tarpits helping to delay the next wave of enshittification.
>
>...
>
>It's hard to tell how widely Nepenthes has been deployed. Site owners are discouraged from flagging when the malware has been deployed, forcing crawlers to face unknown ""consequences"" if they ignore robots.txt instructions.
>
>...
>
>Already blocking scraping and attempting to poison AI models through a simpler method, Nagy took his defense method further and created his own tarpit, Iocaine. He told Ars the tarpit immediately killed off about 94 percent of bot traffic to his site, which was primarily from AI crawlers. Soon, social media discussion drove users to inquire about Iocaine deployment, including not just individuals but also organizations wanting to take stronger steps to block scraping.
>
>Iocaine takes ideas (not code) from Nepenthes, but it's more intent on using the tarpit to poison AI models. Nagy used a reverse proxy to trap crawlers in an ""infinite maze of garbage"" in an attempt to slowly poison their data collection as much as possible for daring to ignore robots.txt.
>
>...
>
>""Any time one of these crawlers pulls from my tarpit, it's resources they've consumed and will have to pay hard cash for, but, being bullshit, the money [they] have spent to get it won't be paid back by revenue,"" Aaron posted, explaining his tactic online. ""It effectively raises their costs. And seeing how none of them have turned a profit yet, that's a big problem for them. The investor money will not continue forever without the investors getting paid.""
>
>...
>
>To Geuter, a computer scientist who has been writing about the social, political, and structural impact of tech for two decades, AI is the ""most aggressive"" example of ""technologies that are not done 'for us' but 'to us.'""
>
>""It feels a bit like the social contract that society and the tech sector/engineering have had (you build useful things, and we're OK with you being well-off) has been canceled from one side,"" Geuter said. ""And that side now wants to have its toy eat the world. People feel threatened and want the threats to stop.""
>
>As AI evolves, so do attacks, with one 2021 study showing that increasingly stronger data poisoning attacks, for example, were able to break data sanitization defenses. Whether these attacks can ever do meaningful destruction or not, Geuter sees tarpits as a ""powerful symbol"" of the resistance that Aaron and Nagy readily joined.
>
>""It's a great sign to see that people are challenging the notion that we all have to do AI now,"" Geuter said. ""Because we don't. It's a choice. A choice that mostly benefits monopolists.""

It was pretty interesting to read about these efforts to resist scraping by various companies and ignoring the robots.txt files in place. If widespread, then this would indicate that the social agreement to respect these files by webcrawlers is no longer effective, and that unfortunately more stringent measures might be required.",

Trump’s new head of DOT rips up US fuel efficiency regulations | Secretary Duffy claims polluting more will make cars cheaper.,"Good, I'm tired of overbuilt and overengineered monstrosities that can't be repaired without propietary/dealer shenanigans that cost more, last less, and likely increase environmental costs because of the fixation on measuring the tail pipe and not the entire supply chain. Remember little, cheap 4 banger pickups or sedans that could be worked on at home that weren't that bad on gas and last decades with basic maintenence? Pepperidge farm remembers. To be clear, I am pro electric. I just don't think the costs in modern ICE vehicles with all the modern features/electronics to shave off a few MPG and help you parallel park or self drive, for example, are justified with so much being imported from overseas using container ships that burn bunker fuel while being produced in areas with zero environmental regulations that look like a dirty, smog filled hellscapes.",

Also disincentivizes innovation – making the industry less competitive over time. And then once the next administration reinstates these common sense regulations... the industry will have fallen behind.

UNLESS of course the industry chooses to ignore this change in order to not fall behind. But then... no car gets cheaper *either*.

"Microsoft stifling competition in cloud services market, finds UK regulator","The UK antitrust regulator has singled out Microsoft for using its dominance in software to stifle rivals in the £9bn UK cloud services market, as the watchdog warned competition “is not working”.

An independent panel acting for the Competition and Markets Authority said on Tuesday that a lack of competition in cloud services was “likely to be leading to higher costs, less choice, less innovation and lower quality of service for businesses and organisations”.

“Microsoft is using its strong position in software to make it harder for Amazon Web Services and Google to compete effectively for cloud customers that wish to use Microsoft software on the cloud,” the panel said in its provisional decision.

It also recommended the CMA use its new powers under the digital markets regime to decide whether Amazon and Microsoft should receive “strategic market status” as a result of their influence in the area.

Under new legislation, which came into force this month, the UK regulator can designate a small group of companies as having such status and impose certain conduct requirements to try to increase competition.

The decision comes as the CMA is under intense pressure from the government to show it is promoting growth, as Labour attempts to increase business investment in the UK. In an unexpected move last week, CMA chair Marcus Bokkerink was ousted by business secretary Jonathan Reynolds and replaced with former Amazon UK head Doug Gurr.

Writing in the Financial Times on Tuesday, Gurr said the agency would look to speed up its investigations to try to unlock greater investment in the country and bring in greater sector expertise so that businesses did not have to waste time educating the regulator about the industry.

The cloud services investigation has been continuing in various forms for more than two years. Ofcom opened a market study in October 2022 and published an interim report before referring it to the CMA a year later.

The CMA inquiry group said a general lack of competition was interfering with customers’ ability “to switch cloud provider or use multiple clouds, which may ultimately impact the price and quality of cloud services”.

Amazon and Microsoft are the two largest providers of cloud services, each with a share of up to 40 per cent of UK customer spend, followed by Google.

Rima Alaily, Microsoft’s deputy general counsel and head of its competition law group, said in a statement that the report “should be focused on paving the way for the UK’s AI-powered future, not fixating on legacy products launched in the last century”.

“The cloud computing market has never been so dynamic and competitive, attracting billions in investments, new entrants and rapid innovation. What could be better for UK businesses and government?” added Alaily. 

Amazon Web Services said the CMA’s proposed intervention was “not warranted” and urged the agency to “carefully consider how regulatory intervention in other areas will stifle innovation and ultimately harm customers in the UK”.

“The evidence demonstrates the IT services industry is highly competitive,” AWS said. “Cloud computing has lowered costs for UK businesses with on-demand services and pay-as-you-go pricing, expanded product choice, and increased competition and innovation.”

Chris Lindsay, Google Cloud’s vice-president for customer engineering in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said: “Restrictive licensing harms UK cloud customers, threatens economic progress and stifles innovation, and we are encouraged that the CMA has recognised the harm of these practices.”

The CMA must publish a final decision by August 4.",

They absolutely already do this. More often than you think.

And it's not just cars, its also motorcycles.

A good example is the CA/CARB version of Harley vs the rest of the 49States version of the bike. the CA/CARB version has emissions hardware and different tunes and stuff like that to meet CARB.

The rest of the same model sold elsewhere/outside the EU will not have this hardware. Instead they have more aggressive tunes and simply do not install the emissions control(except the Cat converter). Despite this the bikes are still actually Euro5 compliant and are really clean engines.

This is not unique to HD and pretty much everyone does it because Cali's economy is so big and powerful and worth selling in.

There are literally millions of cars in the USA and bikes too, that could not be sold in California but can still be sold in Europe(euro5 compliant).",

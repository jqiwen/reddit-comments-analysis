Alibaba releases AI model it says surpasses DeepSeek,"It seems funny to watch the billionaires burn, but China is up to something much more sinister than that. The entire American economic system is dependent on the stock market, and is built around the assumption that it will generally go up forever. 401k‚Äôs, pensions, the valuations of these ‚Äúrichest men in the world‚Äù, basically every major US financial institution is reliant on the value of the S&P, and the tech stocks make up a hugely disproportionate amount of that value. Truly crashing these stocks would be detrimental to the entire American economy. And China absolutely knows that and is twisting the knife trying to drain our value to establish itself as the dominant global power.

Americans have this sense of always being the most powerful, innovative, and influential country in the world because in all our lifetimes, we always have been. But we‚Äôre getting complacent and greedy and prioritizing company profits over genuine innovation, and now another country is genuinely innovating more than us.

Meanwhile, we‚Äôre all the most divided we‚Äôve ever been, spending all our time and energy fighting each other and swindling consumers into paying every cent they possibly can for every product before they all start literally starving. We‚Äôve pushed Capitalism to its limit and this is the result - a system where profits are the only thing that matters, and the appearance of innovation is more valuable than actual innovation. America is about to get a brutal wake up call that we‚Äôre not granted some divine right to always be the top dog in the world, and I just hope we can wake up before it‚Äôs too late.",

Trump‚Äôs new head of DOT rips up US fuel efficiency regulations | Secretary Duffy claims polluting more will make cars cheaper.,"Just FYI- cafe standards are part of the reason there are no small pickups in america. The current emissions standards for pickups are based on MPG to wheelbase ratio, so the flying brick has to be bigger to avoid fines. Of course, the other side of that equation is that the manufacturers don't want to pay those fines. A quick google says it's $14 per 0.1 MPG over times the number of vehicles sold for pickups (I'm trusting the ai overview here).

This is one place where I think some rethinking has to be done. I don't think this is the team to do it, and I don't think that just ripping the band-aid off is the way to go about it.

Also, manufacturers usually spend like ten years doing R&D for a new model, so I doubt they're going to jump right in to production just because this standard has changed dramatically overnight, seeing as the next administration (please let there be a next administration) might put the standards right back.

It's possible that GM might import some small daihatsus or suzukis, but then, if the standards go back, these trucks will either be forced into off highway vehicle status or grandfathered in with some sort of exemption. I could also see international brands like mitsubishi bringing in their already existing small trucks, but chicken tax might make that suck.",

And then China comes in and develops the same tech for pennies on the dollar vs US investors, literally only in the millions compared to hundreds of billions to trillions for US investors.

"Microsoft stifling competition in cloud services market, finds UK regulator","The UK antitrust regulator has singled out Microsoft for using its dominance in software to stifle rivals in the ¬£9bn UK cloud services market, as the watchdog warned competition ‚Äúis not working‚Äù.

An independent panel acting for the Competition and Markets Authority said on Tuesday that a lack of competition in cloud services was ‚Äúlikely to be leading to higher costs, less choice, less innovation and lower quality of service for businesses and organisations‚Äù.

‚ÄúMicrosoft is using its strong position in software to make it harder for Amazon Web Services and Google to compete effectively for cloud customers that wish to use Microsoft software on the cloud,‚Äù the panel said in its provisional decision.

It also recommended the CMA use its new powers under the digital markets regime to decide whether Amazon and Microsoft should receive ‚Äústrategic market status‚Äù as a result of their influence in the area.

Under new legislation, which came into force this month, the UK regulator can designate a small group of companies as having such status and impose certain conduct requirements to try to increase competition.

The decision comes as the CMA is under intense pressure from the government to show it is promoting growth, as Labour attempts to increase business investment in the UK. In an unexpected move last week, CMA chair Marcus Bokkerink was ousted by business secretary Jonathan Reynolds and replaced with former Amazon UK head Doug Gurr.

Writing in the Financial Times on Tuesday, Gurr said the agency would look to speed up its investigations to try to unlock greater investment in the country and bring in greater sector expertise so that businesses did not have to waste time educating the regulator about the industry.

The cloud services investigation has been continuing in various forms for more than two years. Ofcom opened a market study in October 2022 and published an interim report before referring it to the CMA a year later.

The CMA inquiry group said a general lack of competition was interfering with customers‚Äô ability ‚Äúto switch cloud provider or use multiple clouds, which may ultimately impact the price and quality of cloud services‚Äù.

Amazon and Microsoft are the two largest providers of cloud services, each with a share of up to 40 per cent of UK customer spend, followed by Google.

Rima Alaily, Microsoft‚Äôs deputy general counsel and head of its competition law group, said in a statement that the report ‚Äúshould be focused on paving the way for the UK‚Äôs AI-powered future, not fixating on legacy products launched in the last century‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe cloud computing market has never been so dynamic and competitive, attracting billions in investments, new entrants and rapid innovation. What could be better for UK businesses and government?‚Äù added Alaily. 

Amazon Web Services said the CMA‚Äôs proposed intervention was ‚Äúnot warranted‚Äù and urged the agency to ‚Äúcarefully consider how regulatory intervention in other areas will stifle innovation and ultimately harm customers in the UK‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe evidence demonstrates the IT services industry is highly competitive,‚Äù AWS said. ‚ÄúCloud computing has lowered costs for UK businesses with on-demand services and pay-as-you-go pricing, expanded product choice, and increased competition and innovation.‚Äù

Chris Lindsay, Google Cloud‚Äôs vice-president for customer engineering in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said: ‚ÄúRestrictive licensing harms UK cloud customers, threatens economic progress and stifles innovation, and we are encouraged that the CMA has recognised the harm of these practices.‚Äù

The CMA must publish a final decision by August 4.",

To further humiliate them, the project is open source and released by China of all places. You don't like that the model is spitting out gov psyop or some backdoor in the code? The code is public! Go to github, clone the project, inspect the code, and maybe retrain it. The project is open source.

Also afaik, using the output of a model as training data is common practice in machine learning, so idk what's the big deal here.

Moreover, Open AI, a non profit that plans to turn into a for profit with ties to the military industrial complex, trained their model on copyrighted materials that may have been without consent. So uhm, they're whining someone did the same thing to them? I find the hypocrisy amusing

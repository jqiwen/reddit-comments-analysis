"ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says",">To pretend the previous commenter is saying boys don't deserve positive reinforcement instead of calling out a very real double standard that negatively impacts everyone involved demonstrates either bad faith on your part or a lack of reading comprehension. 

I'd normally write this off as another person who doesn't understand the words they've heard smarter people use, but I'm waiting on my coffee so I'll give you the time.

So lets break it down.

>*At least the chat doesn't ignore them*

>*Might be their personality. Maybe a therapist would be a better use of their time.*

The original joke is met with the admonition that maybe those men deserve to be ignored. But it goes on:

>*There's too many men raised by ""boy moms"" and dads who dont think they need to ""raise"" children who told them how special they were*

Here we have the wedging of personal grievances. Which is fine, whatever, but it doesn't make sense. As I noted with my comment:

>*You'll notice basically all of them have some top level variation on ""a girl complimented me once and I've thought about it for the last 6 years.""*

Which is, generally speaking, not the behavior of a cohort that is being lathered in reinforcement and to whom life treats as a special prince.

Does that help?

To maybe scaffold the larger dialogue for you, the thing that both you and the other commenter are missing from the male experience (you are both women, I'm guessing?) is that you are confusing *apathy* for *favoritism*.

The world, largely, does not care about men; [certainly not when there is an opportunity to care about women instead](https://x.com/Try2StopME/status/1588727702932303873). Even parents are less protective of male children. The ""lack of parenting"" you are referring to may seem nice when as a child you are yourself being structured more (obviously the envy carries to this day) but another nearer word would be ""neglect."" And that doesn't end in childhood, it carries forward for our entire lives.",

They claim the answer was:

Regarding the situation in Syria, China has always adhered to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, believing that the Syrian people have the wisdom and capability to handle their own affairs. We hope that Syria can achieve peace and stability at an early date, and that the people can live a peaceful and prosperous life.”

The real DeepSeek revelation: The market doesn’t understand AI,"Good article. Summary:

The market overreacted to DeepSeek’s AI advancements, wiping out $1 trillion in stock value despite the fact that efficiency gains in AI are expected. DeepSeek’s release doesn’t fundamentally change the landscape; AI demand remains insatiable, and major infrastructure investments are still needed. Concerns about China “catching up” are misplaced, as its capabilities were already well known. The real challenge is AI inference, where efficiency matters most. DeepSeek may be useful, but AI companies will still require billions in investment. Nvidia’s dominance could be challenged, but a radical shift remains unlikely.",

"Microsoft stifling competition in cloud services market, finds UK regulator","The UK antitrust regulator has singled out Microsoft for using its dominance in software to stifle rivals in the £9bn UK cloud services market, as the watchdog warned competition “is not working”.

An independent panel acting for the Competition and Markets Authority said on Tuesday that a lack of competition in cloud services was “likely to be leading to higher costs, less choice, less innovation and lower quality of service for businesses and organisations”.

“Microsoft is using its strong position in software to make it harder for Amazon Web Services and Google to compete effectively for cloud customers that wish to use Microsoft software on the cloud,” the panel said in its provisional decision.

It also recommended the CMA use its new powers under the digital markets regime to decide whether Amazon and Microsoft should receive “strategic market status” as a result of their influence in the area.

Under new legislation, which came into force this month, the UK regulator can designate a small group of companies as having such status and impose certain conduct requirements to try to increase competition.

The decision comes as the CMA is under intense pressure from the government to show it is promoting growth, as Labour attempts to increase business investment in the UK. In an unexpected move last week, CMA chair Marcus Bokkerink was ousted by business secretary Jonathan Reynolds and replaced with former Amazon UK head Doug Gurr.

Writing in the Financial Times on Tuesday, Gurr said the agency would look to speed up its investigations to try to unlock greater investment in the country and bring in greater sector expertise so that businesses did not have to waste time educating the regulator about the industry.

The cloud services investigation has been continuing in various forms for more than two years. Ofcom opened a market study in October 2022 and published an interim report before referring it to the CMA a year later.

The CMA inquiry group said a general lack of competition was interfering with customers’ ability “to switch cloud provider or use multiple clouds, which may ultimately impact the price and quality of cloud services”.

Amazon and Microsoft are the two largest providers of cloud services, each with a share of up to 40 per cent of UK customer spend, followed by Google.

Rima Alaily, Microsoft’s deputy general counsel and head of its competition law group, said in a statement that the report “should be focused on paving the way for the UK’s AI-powered future, not fixating on legacy products launched in the last century”.

“The cloud computing market has never been so dynamic and competitive, attracting billions in investments, new entrants and rapid innovation. What could be better for UK businesses and government?” added Alaily. 

Amazon Web Services said the CMA’s proposed intervention was “not warranted” and urged the agency to “carefully consider how regulatory intervention in other areas will stifle innovation and ultimately harm customers in the UK”.

“The evidence demonstrates the IT services industry is highly competitive,” AWS said. “Cloud computing has lowered costs for UK businesses with on-demand services and pay-as-you-go pricing, expanded product choice, and increased competition and innovation.”

Chris Lindsay, Google Cloud’s vice-president for customer engineering in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said: “Restrictive licensing harms UK cloud customers, threatens economic progress and stifles innovation, and we are encouraged that the CMA has recognised the harm of these practices.”

The CMA must publish a final decision by August 4.",

Trump’s new head of DOT rips up US fuel efficiency regulations | Secretary Duffy claims polluting more will make cars cheaper.,"Just FYI- cafe standards are part of the reason there are no small pickups in america. The current emissions standards for pickups are based on MPG to wheelbase ratio, so the flying brick has to be bigger to avoid fines. Of course, the other side of that equation is that the manufacturers don't want to pay those fines. A quick google says it's $14 per 0.1 MPG over times the number of vehicles sold for pickups (I'm trusting the ai overview here).

This is one place where I think some rethinking has to be done. I don't think this is the team to do it, and I don't think that just ripping the band-aid off is the way to go about it.

Also, manufacturers usually spend like ten years doing R&D for a new model, so I doubt they're going to jump right in to production just because this standard has changed dramatically overnight, seeing as the next administration (please let there be a next administration) might put the standards right back.

It's possible that GM might import some small daihatsus or suzukis, but then, if the standards go back, these trucks will either be forced into off highway vehicle status or grandfathered in with some sort of exemption. I could also see international brands like mitsubishi bringing in their already existing small trucks, but chicken tax might make that suck.",

Truly crashing these stocks would be detrimental to the entire American economy. And China absolutely knows that and is twisting the knife trying to drain our value to establish itself as the dominant global power.

Americans have this sense of always being the most powerful, innovative, and influential country in the world because in all our lifetimes, we always have been. But we’re getting complacent and greedy and prioritizing company profits over genuine innovation, and now another country is genuinely innovating more than us.

Meanwhile, we’re all the most divided we’ve ever been, spending all our time and energy fighting each other and swindling consumers into paying every cent they possibly can for every product before they all start literally starving. We’ve pushed Capitalism to its limit and this is the result - a system where profits are the only thing that matters, and the appearance of innovation is more valuable than actual innovation.

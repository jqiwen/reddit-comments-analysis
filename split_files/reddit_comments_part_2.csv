The market overreacted to DeepSeek’s AI advancements, wiping out $1 trillion in stock value despite the fact that efficiency gains in AI are expected.

Concerns about China “catching up” are misplaced, as its capabilities were already well known. The real challenge is AI inference, where efficiency matters most.

"Memes spread conspiracy theories by uniting online groups, shows new research","A new study finds a sinister side to memes, pointing to their role in strengthening online communities of conspiracy theorists.

Shared photos and videos that reinforce a ‘conspiracist worldview’ have a role in building a sense of tribalism and collective opinion within online conspiracy theorist communities, according to researchers from the University of Bath’s School of Management.

The study breaks new ground by analysing the cultural role of memes in online conspiracy communities, published in the journal Social Media + Society.

PhD researcher Emily Godwin, from Bath’s Institute for Digital Security and Behaviour (IDSB), said: “We see from this study that memes play a significant role in reinforcing the culture of online conspiracy theorist communities. Members gravitate towards memes that validate their ‘conspiracist worldview’, and these memes become an important part of their storytelling. Their simple, shareable format then enables the rapid spread of harmful beliefs.”

  
Using data from Reddit, a widely used discussion platform and a hotspot for conspiracy theories, the researchers analysed 544 memes across two interconnected subreddits about Covid-19 between 2020 and 2022: r/NoNewNormal (r/NNN), which was banned by Reddit in September 2021; and r/CoronavirusCirclejerk (r/CvCj).

Memes were found to fall into three broad themes within the online conspiracy theory community: ‘deception’ by authorities and conspirators; ‘delusion’ among the public; and ‘superiority’ of conspiracy believers who see themselves as committed to ‘free thinking’.",

The formula used to calculate what fell within the legal parameters scaled with wheel base.  It's why you can barely find normal midsized vehicles.  It's actually cheaper to make ridiculously large trucks.  It's pretty much killed the market for small trucks and SUVs that are arguably better for the environment while still serving for utility.",

Democratic politicians utilize the aesthetic of responsibility to run ham fisted regulation policies or benefit their corporate donors depending on which wing of the Democratic Party they’re from. Republicans will ignore any evil either because their corporate donors request it or because Donald Trump said so depending on which wing of the Republican Party they’re from.

The X-59 is trying to find ways to reduce the sonic boom to an acceptable level. It does look ridiculous with a very long nose, but if it works...

A supersonic aircraft without this technology will generate a big (standard) sonic boom, which means it will not be allowed to fly over land. This is a large part of what killed the Concorde.

The other part is fuel costs. Does anyone know if the XB-1 can go supersonic without afterburners? (aka ""supercruise"" in military jets).

A commercial plane which can fly supersonic over land AND be fuel-efficient will likely be successful. Now, if only we can kill the airport delays...",

OpenAI Claims DeepSeek Plagiarized. Its Plagiarism Machine.,Like how when Tiktok was harvesting so much data on users that it lead to stricter data privacy laws? lol,
OpenAI Claims DeepSeek Plagiarized. Its Plagiarism Machine.,"I don’t think it’s the same thing.

TikTok is not a media company, it does not exist to sell you advertising, its sole purpose is to train the algorithm and use short videos to create data points.

TikTok doesn’t give a fuck about “creators”, it is carefully curated to keep all the non-entertaining stuff off the platform, and it will never cram ads in between videos, because it wants the experience to be seamless for guinea pigs i.e. users.

(It’s also the reason why even when platforms like YouTube or Facebook try imitating TikTok they can never be as successful at it. Because TikTok isn’t about short videos.)

And all the data it gathers ends up on Chinese servers outside of any jurisdiction, which only the CCP has access to and only the CCP regulates.

DeepSeek, on the other hand, did exactly what OpenAI has been doing since its inception. ChatGPT is a slop generator trained on everything ever created, and now somebody in China did a better and cheaper slop generator - and gave it away for free.

This was actually the stated goal of OpenAI back when they claimed to be non-profit. This was exactly what they said they wanted to do, and this is the only reason why everyone kind of ignored the fact they stole training data in the first place.

Well, OpenAI somehow decided to become for-profit, and now a Chinese company finished the mission.

It’s an identical product but made more efficient, and accessible to anyone - which is exactly why OpenAI has been pointless company literally overnight.

And yes, DeepSeek is censored to comply with Chinese laws, and yes, the online version is still hosted in China. But you can run it locally, and most people don’t care about the censorship if it does the job, instead of paying any subscription to OpenAI.

So while I’m against TikTok’s shit, I’m totally with the Chinese on this one.

Altman created a knock-off generator, pretended that he can lawyer his way to make it okay by Western standards (it isn’t) - and eventually got out-matched by an even better knock-off generator of knock-offs from China. Which is free. And open source.

What’s not to love about that.",

Headed for technofascism’: the rightwing roots of Silicon Valley,"There is a point in that studying STEM exclusively cultivates a positivist and essentialist worldview that leaves little room for the ambiguity or subjectivity that are innate elements of our human condition, while the humanities excel at exploring and providing tools to negotiate these more nuanced aspects of existence.  It’s why the humanities are more equipped to cultivate empathy (And partially why they’re loathed and discredited by the right wing) because the humanities ask students to project themselves and their thinking onto other people’s lived experiences as a means of understanding this diverse existence - and that threatens any attempt to establish a singular hierarchical order. Thus we hear the hysteria that liberal arts departments in universities are indoctrinating a kind of “Cultural Marxism”; or “Wokism” but it’s really just people learning about other histories and being open and sympathetic to diversity; that the world has contexts. While STEM is reductionist in that it boils everything down to a solvable problem if we can only burrow down deep enough we can discover some kind universal “truth”.

AI haters build tarpits to trap and trick AI scrapers that ignore robots.txt | Attackers explain how an anti-spam defense became an AI weapon,"Some of the more interesting highlights:

>Shortly after he noticed Facebook's crawler exceeding 30 million hits on his site, Aaron began plotting a new kind of attack on crawlers ""clobbering"" websites that he told Ars he hoped would give ""teeth"" to robots.txt.
>
>Building on an anti-spam cybersecurity tactic known as tarpitting, he created Nepenthes, malicious software named after a carnivorous plant that will ""eat just about anything that finds its way inside.""
>
>Aaron clearly warns users that Nepenthes is aggressive malware. It's not to be deployed by site owners uncomfortable with trapping AI crawlers and sending them down an ""infinite maze"" of static files with no exit links, where they ""get stuck"" and ""thrash around"" for months, he tells users. Once trapped, the crawlers can be fed gibberish data, aka Markov babble, which is designed to poison AI models. That's likely an appealing bonus feature for any site owners who, like Aaron, are fed up with paying for AI scraping and just want to watch AI burn.
>
>Tarpits were originally designed to waste spammers' time and resources, but creators like Aaron have now evolved the tactic into an anti-AI weapon. As of this writing, Aaron confirmed that Nepenthes can effectively trap all the major web crawlers. So far, only OpenAI's crawler has managed to escape.
>
>...
>
>""We’re aware of efforts to disrupt AI web crawlers,"" OpenAI's spokesperson said. ""We design our systems to be resilient while respecting robots.txt and standard web practices.""
>
>But to Aaron, the fight is not about winning. Instead, it's about resisting the AI industry further decaying the Internet with tech that no one asked for, like chatbots that replace customer service agents or the rise of inaccurate AI search summaries. By releasing Nepenthes, he hopes to do as much damage as possible, perhaps spiking companies' AI training costs, dragging out training efforts, or even accelerating model collapse, with tarpits helping to delay the next wave of enshittification.
>
>...
>
>It's hard to tell how widely Nepenthes has been deployed. Site owners are discouraged from flagging when the malware has been deployed, forcing crawlers to face unknown ""consequences"" if they ignore robots.txt instructions.
>
>...
>
>Already blocking scraping and attempting to poison AI models through a simpler method, Nagy took his defense method further and created his own tarpit, Iocaine. He told Ars the tarpit immediately killed off about 94 percent of bot traffic to his site, which was primarily from AI crawlers. Soon, social media discussion drove users to inquire about Iocaine deployment, including not just individuals but also organizations wanting to take stronger steps to block scraping.
>
>Iocaine takes ideas (not code) from Nepenthes, but it's more intent on using the tarpit to poison AI models. Nagy used a reverse proxy to trap crawlers in an ""infinite maze of garbage"" in an attempt to slowly poison their data collection as much as possible for daring to ignore robots.txt.
>
>...
>
>""Any time one of these crawlers pulls from my tarpit, it's resources they've consumed and will have to pay hard cash for, but, being bullshit, the money [they] have spent to get it won't be paid back by revenue,"" Aaron posted, explaining his tactic online. ""It effectively raises their costs. And seeing how none of them have turned a profit yet, that's a big problem for them. The investor money will not continue forever without the investors getting paid.""
>

>To Geuter, a computer scientist who has been writing about the social, political, and structural impact of tech for two decades, AI is the ""most aggressive"" example of ""technologies that are not done 'for us' but 'to us.'""
>
>""It feels a bit like the social contract that society and the tech sector/engineering have had (you build useful things, and we're OK with you being well-off) has been canceled from one side,"" Geuter said. ""And that side now wants to have its toy eat the world. People feel threatened and want the threats to stop.""
>
>As AI evolves, so do attacks, with one 2021 study showing that increasingly stronger data poisoning attacks, for example, were able to break data sanitization defenses. Whether these attacks can ever do meaningful destruction or not, Geuter sees tarpits as a ""powerful symbol"" of the resistance that Aaron and Nagy readily joined.
>
>""It's a great sign to see that people are challenging the notion that we all have to do AI now,"" Geuter said. ""Because we don't. It's a choice. A choice that mostly benefits monopolists.""

It was pretty interesting to read about these efforts to resist scraping by various companies and ignoring the robots.txt files in place. If widespread, then this would indicate that the social agreement to respect these files by webcrawlers is no longer effective, and that unfortunately more stringent measures might be required.",

Trump’s new head of DOT rips up US fuel efficiency regulations | Secretary Duffy claims polluting more will make cars cheaper.,"Yeah CAFE regs are an utter disaster for the environment and safety. There's been very little innovation in actual emissions because the loophole is ""just make everything 6000 pounds+"" and small cars that polluted less in the 90s don't exist outside of the MX-5.

Instead we're wasting metal and plastic on monstrous subway train sized SUVs and pickups that carry single occupants. They're so huge that pedestrian injuries and deaths have rocketed up in the past several years, because hoodlines are 5ft now. My uncle was killed this Thanksgiving from a hit and run by a massive pickup. You can't survive in cars either, NHTSA regs mean shit when you're hit by an 8,000 pickup drinking and driving or texting, no matter how good your crash safety rating is. We need to start having safety regs that emphasize protecting other people and cars instead of only the occupants in your own vehicle.

There's a reason imported japanese kei trucks are wildly popular, because they're small, reliable, and cheap and do 90% of the job of a full size pickup (sans towing, but over 75% of pickup owners never tow). They became so popular that they're being banned state by state by the dealership lobby because they're eating into pickup sales. 

I hate Shitler and Edolf at the core of my being but dismantling CAFE was the one thing I hoped they do, given it was an Obama era reg (and Shitler is determined to undo everything Obama did). We won't get better emissions regs out of it, but hopefully we'll see the return of small cars and pickup again.",

Headed for technofascism’: the rightwing roots of Silicon Valley,"There is a point in that studying STEM exclusively cultivates a positivist and essentialist worldview that leaves little room for the ambiguity or subjectivity that are innate elements of our human condition, while the humanities excel at exploring and providing tools to negotiate these more nuanced aspects of existence.  It’s why the humanities are more equipped to cultivate empathy (And partially why they’re loathed and discredited by the right wing) because the humanities ask students to project themselves and their thinking onto other people’s lived experiences as a means of understanding this diverse existence - and that threatens any attempt to establish a singular hierarchical order. Thus we hear the hysteria that liberal arts departments in universities are indoctrinating a kind of “Cultural Marxism”; or “Wokism” but it’s really just people learning about other histories and being open and sympathetic to diversity; that the world has contexts. While STEM is reductionist in that it boils everything down to a solvable problem if we can only burrow down deep enough we can discover some kind universal “truth”.  We’ve done a great disservice to young people by ignoring the humanities imo. They’re equally important to a well rounded education.",

Alibaba releases AI model it says surpasses DeepSeek,"It's not that people thought they would sit it out. 


It's that they have accomplished it in a way that completely exposed the American companies for their ineptitude bordering on a scam. 


American companies had convinced people that AI would just have to be an extremely energy intensive process and there was no way around it. So they had to spend hundreds of billions of dollars building data centres and nuclear plants to generate energy. 


Trump literally used AI as the excuse for why if the US pursued climate initiatives they would get left behind. 


American AI would be deeply harmful to the environment. One image prompt uses as much energy as a plastic bottle of water. 


DeepSeek proved all of that was false. You could run it on a personal laptop even. And it cost pennies to make in comparison. ",

OpenAI Claims DeepSeek Plagiarized.

I bet mr altman himself is studying m/copying code from Deepseek now, but he will never admit it. 

I doubt Deepseek will become another giant in the industry, but they provided a much needed financial and technological correction for the industry.

The US does have US production of those types of cars. That's why Biden kept what Trump had already put in place. 

The problem is that this admin isn't really promoting production of those types of cars and incentives are still for gas powered. So now the tariffs just make things more expensive instead with no real domestic comparable product.",

(1) education is most important as you need the most disaggregated and best information processing systems amongst your society

(3) free markets and anti-monopolies are another form of protecting economic information systems. Insomuch as more economic resources are consolidated to a few corporates - the information system breaks down 
(4) respecting differing views is important because group think or loudly overshadowing other view again destroys the information system
(5) utilizing psychological tactics to corrupt individuals thought processes becomes counter productive as it again removes freedom of thought and processing within that system. 

I often note that even a philosopher king would fail because once a system becomes too limited in information gathering and processing - it becomes harder and harder to manage chaotic systems. There isn’t enough freedom in the processing and gathering of information for society to operate optimally.",

OpenAI Claims DeepSeek Plagiarized. Its Plagiarism Machine.,"Great points!

I always think of [United States v. One Book Called Ulysses](https://famous-trials.com/ulysses/2652-judge-woolsey-s-decision-admit-ulysses-into-the-u-s) (although this is in the case of censorship of the obscene, not copyright, **bold** is mine):

>But when such a great artist in words, as Joyce undoubtedly is, seeks to draw a **true picture** of the lower middle class in a European city, **ought it to be impossible for the American public legally to see that picture**?

If so much of the cultural world around us exists (which we experience whether we want to or not) in the form of copyrighted slogans, logos, characters, stories, etc.—any accurate relation of that experience *must include those things*. I do not understand any argument that an LLM accurately portraying a picture of the world as it is (or an imaginative variant of it), copyright & all, as any different.

The argument usually comes down to who is getting paid for what, & my conclusion from all of that is that capitalists are claiming ownership of things that ought to be public,. 

So, less for Disney & less for Sam Altman, open-source LLMs for the people, & you should be able to make your own Harry Potter comic book if you want to. Copyright in 1776 was 7 years after publication. Shit or get off the pot.",
OpenAI Claims DeepSeek Plagiarized. Its Plagiarism Machine.,"People are missing the point of this. None of these people give a fuck about plagiarism, or consider LLMs to be that. That's not what makes this accusation incendiary.

DeepSeek wasn't just another LLM. The reason why they shook the market was the notion that they did it for cheap, made a model for like 1% the cost and time of existing ones. 

If true, that would open the door to purpose-built LLM models, like a game company wanting to use AI for its NPC dialogue could train it entirely on in-world lore and text, and have a model which could never randomly start talking about real-world things (as current ones are wont to do). It was revolutionary. 

But if they did that by copying someone else's work, well then all that goes out the window. It's not a new model for cheap, it's the same model for a surcharge. That's what OpenAI is saying, at least.",
OpenAI Claims DeepSeek Plagiarized. Its Plagiarism Machine.,"I don’t think it’s the same thing.

TikTok is not a media company, it does not exist to sell you advertising, its sole purpose is to train the algorithm and use short videos to create data points.

TikTok doesn’t give a fuck about “creators”, it is carefully curated to keep all the non-entertaining stuff off the platform, and it will never cram ads in between videos, because it wants the experience to be seamless for guinea pigs i.e. users.

(It’s also the reason why even when platforms like YouTube or Facebook try imitating TikTok they can never be as successful at it. Because TikTok isn’t about short videos.)

And all the data it gathers ends up on Chinese servers outside of any jurisdiction, which only the CCP has access to and only the CCP regulates.

DeepSeek, on the other hand, did exactly what OpenAI has been doing since its inception. ChatGPT is a slop generator trained on everything ever created, and now somebody in China did a better and cheaper slop generator - and gave it away for free.

This was actually the stated goal of OpenAI back when they claimed to be non-profit. This was exactly what they said they wanted to do, and this is the only reason why everyone kind of ignored the fact they stole training data in the first place.

Well, OpenAI somehow decided to become for-profit, and now a Chinese company finished the mission.

It’s an identical product but made more efficient, and accessible to anyone - which is exactly why OpenAI has been pointless company literally overnight.

And yes, DeepSeek is censored to comply with Chinese laws, and yes, the online version is still hosted in China. But you can run it locally, and most people don’t care about the censorship if it does the job, instead of paying any subscription to OpenAI.

So while I’m against TikTok’s shit, I’m totally with the Chinese on this one.

Altman created a knock-off generator, pretended that he can lawyer his way to make it okay by Western standards (it isn’t) - and eventually got out-matched by an even better knock-off generator of knock-offs from China. Which is free. And open source.

What’s not to love about that.",

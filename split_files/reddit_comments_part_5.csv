Trump‚Äôs new head of DOT rips up US fuel efficiency regulations | Secretary Duffy claims polluting more will make cars cheaper.,">Why does these people hate america and everyone in it so much?

It's astoundingly simple. Poor and sick people who are given permission to hate openly and directed to hate ""the other"" as the source of their problems are much easier to lie to, especially if you weaken the quality of everything that they need, such as their education, their health care, and if you keep them one hair away from being evicted.",

Among the items confiscated from the mansion of Lieutenant General Gu Junshan's family in Puyang, Henan province were a pure gold statue of Mao Zedong, a gold wash basin, a model boat made of gold and crates of mao-tai liquor. Gu‚Äôs two brothers also owned homes next to the family mansion, and the three homes were linked together by a more than 30-metre-long basement stacked with crates of expensive liquor. Most of these remained untouched as Gu had not lived there for many years, according to a Caixin report.](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1406027/new-details-emerge-disgraced-general-gu-junshans-graft-loot)

OpenAI Furious DeepSeek Might Have Stolen All the Data OpenAI Stole From Us,"Let's use an LLM to ponder this irony.

""There is a nuanced aspect to this topic that often goes unnoticed. The practice of AI companies utilizing publicly available data to develop new large language models is distinctly different from an AI company using another company's large language model to create their own. While both practices are open to debate, they are not identical.
The distinction lies in the source and ownership of the data being used to create large language models (LLMs).

When AI companies utilize publicly available data, they are drawing from a wide range of sources that are generally accessible to anyone. This practice raises ethical and legal questions about the use of publicly available content, but it doesn't involve appropriating the specific work or intellectual property of another company.

On the other hand, when one AI company uses another company's LLM to create their own, it directly involves leveraging the proprietary work of another entity. This practice raises additional concerns about intellectual property rights, competitive fairness, and potential violations of licensing agreements. Essentially, the first scenario deals with the broader use of public data, while the second involves the use of a competitor‚Äôs specific, proprietary technology.""",

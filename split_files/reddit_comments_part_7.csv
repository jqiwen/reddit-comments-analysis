"ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says","I’m woman mechanical engineer. I read a study a while back that tried to explain why women don’t go into mechanical engineering.
Their conclusion was that the major is not marketed to women. Women want to help others. If mechanical engineering departments rephrased their marketing from “come build cool big engines” to “come build medical equipment that saves lives” it would attract more women. 

I also find this true with my coworkers. I absolutely get insane joy from seeing people benefit from things I designed while my male coworkers enjoy making something optimized. Some don’t even care about the end user.",

"Chinese firms ‘distilling’ US AI models to create rival products, warns OpenAI","It’s completely reliant on the data from the larger model, meaning it can’t improve on its own. It’s like you copying your friend’s homework and then pretending like you could replicate it without them moving forward. You can’t unless you also do the same training they did. 

It’s also not mapping the same data. It’s only able to access pieces of it 

As far as IP goes, it’s the same reason companies can’t just copy a new medication and sell it for less than the company that developed it. That’s very different from using articles to train a model on how to write like a human, which would be like stealing your friend’s textbooks to study them - which is quite different from copying their answers on your homework",

"Memes spread conspiracy theories by uniting online groups, shows new research","A new study finds a sinister side to memes, pointing to their role in strengthening online communities of conspiracy theorists.

Shared photos and videos that reinforce a ‘conspiracist worldview’ have a role in building a sense of tribalism and collective opinion within online conspiracy theorist communities, according to researchers from the University of Bath’s School of Management.

The study breaks new ground by analysing the cultural role of memes in online conspiracy communities, published in the journal Social Media + Society.

PhD researcher Emily Godwin, from Bath’s Institute for Digital Security and Behaviour (IDSB), said: “We see from this study that memes play a significant role in reinforcing the culture of online conspiracy theorist communities. Members gravitate towards memes that validate their ‘conspiracist worldview’, and these memes become an important part of their storytelling. Their simple, shareable format then enables the rapid spread of harmful beliefs.”

  
Using data from Reddit, a widely used discussion platform and a hotspot for conspiracy theories, the researchers analysed 544 memes across two interconnected subreddits about Covid-19 between 2020 and 2022: r/NoNewNormal (r/NNN), which was banned by Reddit in September 2021; and r/CoronavirusCirclejerk (r/CvCj).

Memes were found to fall into three broad themes within the online conspiracy theory community: ‘deception’ by authorities and conspirators; ‘delusion’ among the public; and ‘superiority’ of conspiracy believers who see themselves as committed to ‘free thinking’.",

Headed for technofascism’: the rightwing roots of Silicon Valley,"Yea it’s a weird subculture to say the least. 

I think they are all falling into the trap of information - they believe in the austere worldview that more information is better and that we should ignore all of humanity for the past few thousand years and go merely by this or that specific information I have.  

It’s often an extreme libertarian view with the additions of data driven concepts.  

Personally I do think more information is better and follow a worldview that we should go via information.  But I also think human systems intuitive understand certain concepts of organization and that democracy / freedom of input from many sources is most important.  

In the techno-libertarian worldview - we should steamroll society to mold it into what we feel our data says. Which is meaningless and dangerous - the data mostly comes from the disaggregated and free society and that’s how it’s most useful.  Once u corrupt the freedom of that information source it becomes hard to manage outcomes or have a working society. 

I almost feel this is a human form of the information problem that AI encounters - feed the same information in continuously and it will just disintegrate in its usefulness.  

I wish the tech bro culture could realize that the information system and it’s freedom are what’s really important and as much as any people begin actively working to corrupt that freedom (say by affecting major social media platforms / making their voice the loudest in the room / pontificating about forcing people to their worldview) they start to destroy the entirety of the information system",

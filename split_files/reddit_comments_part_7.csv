"ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says","There's such a thing as toxic positivity. They get reinforcement from one biased source and cannot comprehend why others do not follow suit. Because the source down plays negative aspects of their personality, they assume they are ""fine"" without acknowledging what is stopping others from giving them attention and positivity 

The men saying they thought about a woman complimenting them likely have gotten positive reinforcement from a parent before. But they aren't getting it outside the home. The fact remains people as a whole are nice and friendly to people who appear safe and friendly to them. If women do not feel secure around you, they will not approach you, for a start. If you do not put yourself in situations where positive feedback is possible, you will not get any, either. If you are negative or aggressive, you will likely be avoided. 

These are men getting reinforcement that's not earned and not understanding no one without a biased interest is going to view them as the same kind of ""special"". There's 8 billion people in the world. No one is actually special. What you can be is the type of person people want to be around, however, in your community",

Trump’s new head of DOT rips up US fuel efficiency regulations | Secretary Duffy claims polluting more will make cars cheaper.,"Idk the details of this (I am sure it has some other consequences from incompetence like much of Trump admin changes) but US regulation is why we have bigger cars/trucks then the rest of the world. Corporate Average Fuel Economy  [ CAFE] standards have a loophole for 'light trucks' which allows them to have a lower mpg average requirement then normal cars. This loophole was expanded during the bush era to tie mpg requirements to  a vehicle physical size. Basically the bigger the vehicle the lower the mpg requirement which resulted in Us car manufacturers building bigger cars to avoid mpg requirements.

Normally I would be on board with revising this regulation as it is not doing what it intended. Instead of focusing on building fuel efficient cars manufacturers focus on building bigger cars with lower mpg requirements meaning we are selling more less efficient vehicles. It needs a rework. 

Yet I don't trust this admin to do it correctly. If I understand correctly this basically removes regulations, it doesn't refactor them to be better. So now car manufacturers can sell both big and even less fuel efficient vehicles. My only hope here is that car manufacturers not really utilizing this as it is likely to revert back to being regulated the second Dems retake power (if that even happens :( )",

Trump’s new head of DOT rips up US fuel efficiency regulations | Secretary Duffy claims polluting more will make cars cheaper.,">We could make cars cheaper by getting rid of all the bells and whistles. Give us cheap, fuel-efficient no-frills cars.

We have / had that, and American consumers do not want those vehicles, because cheap almost always equals smaller and somewhat lower quality. 

For example, Ford released the Maverick truck / CUV in 2022. In base XL hybrid form, it had an MSRP of $19,995 at the time. I and probably thousands of other people tried to order one brand new, and we had our orders canceled because Ford chose to build very few of those models because they made very little profit on them. 

But a lot of Americans don't want a vehicle like that, because it is not the typical truck, it's bed is only about 4 and 1/2 ft long, and it can't tow more than 2,000 lb, at least at the time.",

This wouldn’t just risk investment in tech stocks (which a lot of retirement pension plans are currently relying on, which is the main vector of harm I’m talking about when I refer to blowing up investment capital), but a run on confidence in the US as a whole. 

If China is suddenly seen as completely owning both the future of tech as well as current manufacturing capability, it would seem like a safer place to store capital in spite of the authoritarian behavior that caused investors to flee China over the last couple of years. This would be EXTREMELY bad for everyone in the US, not just tech investors, who would probably be much better off than the rest of America. Americans have not had real problems the last couple of decades the way the rest of the (developing) world has, and now we think moral problems outweigh material ones.

Google has always used publicly available data to create their most valuable asset: their search index. 

Here’s what the memo actually says are “potential” issues:

• Using AI to “foster or advance deception.”

>California’s memo makes clear that companies that use AI to create “deepfakes, chatbots, and voice clones that appear to represent people, events, and utterances that never existed” could fall under the category of “deceptive” and, thus, be considered a breach of state law.

• Falsely advertising “the accuracy, quality, or utility of AI systems.”

>…companies should refrain from “claiming that an AI system has a capability that it does not; representing that a system is completely powered by AI when humans are responsible for performing some of its functions; representing that humans are responsible for performing some of a system’s functions when AI is responsible instead; or claiming without basis that a system is accurate, performs tasks better than a human would, has specified characteristics, meets industry or other standards, or is free from bias.

•Create or sell an AI system or product that has “an adverse or disproportionate impact on members of a protected class, or create, reinforce, or perpetuate discrimination or segregation of members of a protected class.“

Manipulation from Abroad: German Election Campaign Flooded with Fake News and Videos,"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz allegedly has one. So, too, does Green Party co-chair Franziska Brantner. A multi-million-dollar villa in California.

Scholz, according to the narrative, owns a choice estate in the Hollywood Hills – or did, at least, until it was burned down in the fires. That, at least, was the claim espoused by a recent video, complete with aerial shots of a spectacular mansion.

Many videos currently circulating on social media channels, particularly TikTok, are reinforcing a popular cliché: namely that those at the top earn millions and betray the interests of ordinary people.

The problem, though, is that the videos are complete and utter fabrications.

Russian-Produced Fakes On Elon Musk’s channel X, a clip is circulating showing a uniformed police officer who introduces himself as Cameron. He says he is happy he works in the United Kingdom and not in Germany. According to information received by his agency, he says, a series of major terrorist attacks are being prepared in Germany during the country’s snap parliamentary elections in February. ""Share this video with your friends and family,"" he says.

This video, too, is a fake, likely produced in Russia. The creators took clips from real videos and, as the activists from the fake-news awareness group Antibot4Navalny learned, then used artificial intelligence to distort the voices.

The internet is currently full of countless other manipulations, all with a single goal: to trigger chaos and uncertainty ahead of German elections in an effort to strengthen the political fringes.

  
The attacks aren’t just coming from the east, but also from the west, from the U.S., the erstwhile beacon of freedom and democracy. Elon Musk, the wealthiest man in the world and the owner of both X and Tesla, a man who has developed an almost manic interest in German politics of late, has become a new heavyweight distributor of disinformation. He recently livestreamed a bizarre discussion on X with Alice Weidel, the head of the radical right-wing party Alternative for Germany (AfD) and has repeatedly encouraged voters to back extremist parties. He has also used X to disseminate conspiracy theories designed to boost the fortunes of right-wing populist and right-wing extremist parties around the world",

Headed for technofascism’: the rightwing roots of Silicon Valley,"Yea it’s a weird subculture to say the least. 

I think they are all falling into the trap of information - they believe in the austere worldview that more information is better and that we should ignore all of humanity for the past few thousand years and go merely by this or that specific information I have.  

It’s often an extreme libertarian view with the additions of data driven concepts.  

Personally I do think more information is better and follow a worldview that we should go via information.  But I also think human systems intuitive understand certain concepts of organization and that democracy / freedom of input from many sources is most important.  

In the techno-libertarian worldview - we should steamroll society to mold it into what we feel our data says. Which is meaningless and dangerous - the data mostly comes from the disaggregated and free society and that’s how it’s most useful.  Once u corrupt the freedom of that information source it becomes hard to manage outcomes or have a working society. 

I almost feel this is a human form of the information problem that AI encounters - feed the same information in continuously and it will just disintegrate in its usefulness.  

I wish the tech bro culture could realize that the information system and it’s freedom are what’s really important and as much as any people begin actively working to corrupt that freedom (say by affecting major social media platforms / making their voice the loudest in the room / pontificating about forcing people to their worldview) they start to destroy the entirety of the information system",

Headed for technofascism‚Äô: the rightwing roots of Silicon Valley,"There is a point in that studying STEM exclusively cultivates a positivist and essentialist worldview that leaves little room for the ambiguity or subjectivity that are innate elements of our human condition, while the humanities excel at exploring and providing tools to negotiate these more nuanced aspects of existence.  It‚Äôs why the humanities are more equipped to cultivate empathy (And partially why they‚Äôre loathed and discredited by the right wing) because the humanities ask students to project themselves and their thinking onto other people‚Äôs lived experiences as a means of understanding this diverse existence - and that threatens any attempt to establish a singular hierarchical order. Thus we hear the hysteria that liberal arts departments in universities are indoctrinating a kind of ‚ÄúCultural Marxism‚Äù; or ‚ÄúWokism‚Äù but it‚Äôs really just people learning about other histories and being open and sympathetic to diversity; that the world has contexts. While STEM is reductionist in that it boils everything down to a solvable problem if we can only burrow down deep enough we can discover some kind universal ‚Äútruth‚Äù.

That dried up.  Now to keep making profit they need to reduce costs, optimize and reduce opex.  To do that, you need to cut cut cut.  Cut free food, cut health benefits, cut wages, etc...  but what you can't cut is profit and shareholder value / CEO returns.

Trump‚Äôs new head of DOT rips up US fuel efficiency regulations | Secretary Duffy claims polluting more will make cars cheaper.,"Yeah CAFE regs are an utter disaster for the environment and safety. There's been very little innovation in actual emissions because the loophole is ""just make everything 6000 pounds+"" and small cars that polluted less in the 90s don't exist outside of the MX-5.

Instead we're wasting metal and plastic on monstrous subway train sized SUVs and pickups that carry single occupants. They're so huge that pedestrian injuries and deaths have rocketed up in the past several years, because hoodlines are 5ft now. My uncle was killed this Thanksgiving from a hit and run by a massive pickup. You can't survive in cars either, NHTSA regs mean shit when you're hit by an 8,000 pickup drinking and driving or texting, no matter how good your crash safety rating is. We need to start having safety regs that emphasize protecting other people and cars instead of only the occupants in your own vehicle.

There's a reason imported japanese kei trucks are wildly popular, because they're small, reliable, and cheap and do 90% of the job of a full size pickup (sans towing, but over 75% of pickup owners never tow). They became so popular that they're being banned state by state by the dealership lobby because they're eating into pickup sales. 

I hate Shitler and Edolf at the core of my being but dismantling CAFE was the one thing I hoped they do, given it was an Obama era reg (and Shitler is determined to undo everything Obama did). We won't get better emissions regs out of it, but hopefully we'll see the return of small cars and pickup again.",

"Chinese firms ‘distilling’ US AI models to create rival products, warns OpenAI","Umm, no. It’s not innovative to copy someone else’s homework because it means you can’t improve upon it since you’re entirely reliant on their dataset - and in this case specific pieces of it.

Trump’s new head of DOT rips up US fuel efficiency regulations | Secretary Duffy claims polluting more will make cars cheaper.,Yeah I wish I had more information on which regulations are being talked about here.

So now everyone drives bigger less efficient vehicles which also make traffic incidents more dangerous. ,

OpenAI Claims DeepSeek Plagiarized. Its Plagiarism Machine.,"People who aren't copyright lawyers can know plenty about copyright law. Doctorow is a prominent figure in the free-culture movement. That movement takes copyright *very* seriously; I participate in it via Wikipedia, where the exact bounds of copyright and fair use *matter* because we can only use material that's public domain (not protected by copyright), under a free-content license, or that's fair use in context. [Wikipedia:Non-free content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Non-free_content) is perhaps good reading.

More broadly, read what Doctorow says carefully, because he provides a *variety* of *practical examples* of other sorts of use of copyrighted works that are *clearly* reasonable but that would almost certainly be copyright infringement if we apply the same assumptions that are applied to call model-training infringing. Importantly, Doctorow doesn't *like* AI; the focus here is on holding copyright law to its logical limitations and exceptions as established. I also particularly like Doctorow's thoughtful discussion of AI and copyright in the context of creative labour markets.",

The investments have already been made and they don’t want to scrap them just to be forced to reimplement them later on.

They aren’t going to build separate cars for California. They’re going to roll out every car to meet California standards. I bought my truck in Iowa and it still meets California standards.

OpenAI Claims DeepSeek Plagiarized. Its Plagiarism Machine.,"If it is true that DeepSeek gleaned from ChatGPT, then DeepSeek wasn’t possible to achieve without the thousands of GPU hours GPT was shaped by, counter to their main claim to fame.

It’s as if ChatGPT is a sculptor copying a scene of human models, taking weeks to carve marble into a statue. Sure, on one level, people are upset the marble statues aren’t humanity but instead emulations gleaned from humanity.

But if DeepSeek can produce the same statue in a few days, that efficiency is big news in the sculpting world. Except now, it seems DeepSeek is a sculptor who was only able to do that by taking a mold of GPT’s finished marble statue.

Dismissing GPT for being derivative of human works misses the meat of the implication. But US AI firms are definitely mad as hell and I’m slow to accept their claims about DeepSeek, for sure.",

It feels like with electric cars, which was the same with gadgets, itself a repeat of mass produced products... China has been loudly announcing all the 5 year plans and showing of the infrastructure development so why are serious people that are apparently experts in the markets suddenly confused that the people who keep doing what they say they will have once again followed the plan they clearly and publicly laid out? 

Also it's still spooky to me that no one is talking about the absolute certainty that the nsa has a model trained on their giant catalogue of intercepted internet communications, china, russia et al likely do too and none of the models are going to have any restrictions or morals. We know they copy all internet data, we know they have one of the largest super computers in the world, we know they have an almost unlimited hidden budget... it's easier than most people realize to train a good ai and all these stories highlight that so maybe we need to start wondering if we're getting such good free ones what is actually out there at the top levels?",

It's that they have accomplished it in a way that completely exposed the American companies for their ineptitude bordering on a scam. 


American companies had convinced people that AI would just have to be an extremely energy intensive process and there was no way around it. So they had to spend hundreds of billions of dollars building data centres and nuclear plants to generate energy. 


Trump literally used AI as the excuse for why if the US pursued climate initiatives they would get left behind. 


American AI would be deeply harmful to the environment. One image prompt uses as much energy as a plastic bottle of water.

OpenAI Claims DeepSeek Plagiarized. Its Plagiarism Machine.,"People are missing the point of this. None of these people give a fuck about plagiarism, or consider LLMs to be that. That's not what makes this accusation incendiary.

DeepSeek wasn't just another LLM. The reason why they shook the market was the notion that they did it for cheap, made a model for like 1% the cost and time of existing ones. 

If true, that would open the door to purpose-built LLM models, like a game company wanting to use AI for its NPC dialogue could train it entirely on in-world lore and text, and have a model which could never randomly start talking about real-world things (as current ones are wont to do). It was revolutionary. 

But if they did that by copying someone else's work, well then all that goes out the window. It's not a new model for cheap, it's the same model for a surcharge. That's what OpenAI is saying, at least.",

OpenAI Furious DeepSeek Might Have Stolen All the Data OpenAI Stole From Us,"Let's use an LLM to ponder this irony.

""There is a nuanced aspect to this topic that often goes unnoticed. The practice of AI companies utilizing publicly available data to develop new large language models is distinctly different from an AI company using another company's large language model to create their own. While both practices are open to debate, they are not identical.
The distinction lies in the source and ownership of the data being used to create large language models (LLMs).

When AI companies utilize publicly available data, they are drawing from a wide range of sources that are generally accessible to anyone. This practice raises ethical and legal questions about the use of publicly available content, but it doesn't involve appropriating the specific work or intellectual property of another company.

On the other hand, when one AI company uses another company's LLM to create their own, it directly involves leveraging the proprietary work of another entity. This practice raises additional concerns about intellectual property rights, competitive fairness, and potential violations of licensing agreements. Essentially, the first scenario deals with the broader use of public data, while the second involves the use of a competitor’s specific, proprietary technology.""",

Manipulation from Abroad: German Election Campaign Flooded with Fake News and Videos,"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz allegedly has one. So, too, does Green Party co-chair Franziska Brantner. A multi-million-dollar villa in California.

Scholz, according to the narrative, owns a choice estate in the Hollywood Hills – or did, at least, until it was burned down in the fires. That, at least, was the claim espoused by a recent video, complete with aerial shots of a spectacular mansion.

Many videos currently circulating on social media channels, particularly TikTok, are reinforcing a popular cliché: namely that those at the top earn millions and betray the interests of ordinary people.

The problem, though, is that the videos are complete and utter fabrications.

Russian-Produced Fakes On Elon Musk’s channel X, a clip is circulating showing a uniformed police officer who introduces himself as Cameron. He says he is happy he works in the United Kingdom and not in Germany. According to information received by his agency, he says, a series of major terrorist attacks are being prepared in Germany during the country’s snap parliamentary elections in February. ""Share this video with your friends and family,"" he says.

This video, too, is a fake, likely produced in Russia. The creators took clips from real videos and, as the activists from the fake-news awareness group Antibot4Navalny learned, then used artificial intelligence to distort the voices.

The internet is currently full of countless other manipulations, all with a single goal: to trigger chaos and uncertainty ahead of German elections in an effort to strengthen the political fringes.

  
The attacks aren’t just coming from the east, but also from the west, from the U.S., the erstwhile beacon of freedom and democracy. Elon Musk, the wealthiest man in the world and the owner of both X and Tesla, a man who has developed an almost manic interest in German politics of late, has become a new heavyweight distributor of disinformation. He recently livestreamed a bizarre discussion on X with Alice Weidel, the head of the radical right-wing party Alternative for Germany (AfD) and has repeatedly encouraged voters to back extremist parties. He has also used X to disseminate conspiracy theories designed to boost the fortunes of right-wing populist and right-wing extremist parties around the world",

AI research team claims to reproduce DeepSeek core technologies for $30,"Here's the problem...these major tech companies in the US all sold AI to investors and the public as this massive, powerful wave of the future, as a way to justify getting investors to pour hundreds of billions if not trillions in funding into these companies, to develop cutting edge AI that was somehow going to generate massive returns.

And then China comes in and develops the same tech for pennies on the dollar vs US investors, literally only in the millions compared to hundreds of billions to trillions for US investors.

They're screwed...big tech is screwed...it's a massive bubble waiting to pop. You're (investors) never getting a return on that trillion dollar investment, lol. As soon as these investors realize that, they're going to pull out. Valuations are at such high levels, to levels we saw during the tech bubble of the 90's and 2000. This is tech bubble 2.0.",

You can download everything for free and begin executing your own LLMs or Neural Nets on your PC. Your only limitation is the GPU and Time. 

If you're reffering to that training data aspect, I don't know. I don't know if Deepseek actually used the same training data that OpenAi compiled, in which case you have a point. Otherwise, the model itself isn't something that was a ""knock off"". All models are built on top of each other.",

I figure it'll be a set back from unrealistic valuations for some companies but not the end of the world.

DeepSeek wasn't just another LLM. The reason why they shook the market was the notion that they did it for cheap, made a model for like 1% the cost and time of existing ones. 

If true, that would open the door to purpose-built LLM models, like a game company wanting to use AI for its NPC dialogue could train it entirely on in-world lore and text, and have a model which could never randomly start talking about real-world things (as current ones are wont to do). It was revolutionary.

OpenAI Claims DeepSeek Plagiarized. Its Plagiarism Machine.,"I don’t think it’s the same thing.

TikTok is not a media company, it does not exist to sell you advertising, its sole purpose is to train the algorithm and use short videos to create data points.

TikTok doesn’t give a fuck about “creators”, it is carefully curated to keep all the non-entertaining stuff off the platform, and it will never cram ads in between videos, because it wants the experience to be seamless for guinea pigs i.e. users.

(It’s also the reason why even when platforms like YouTube or Facebook try imitating TikTok they can never be as successful at it. Because TikTok isn’t about short videos.)

And all the data it gathers ends up on Chinese servers outside of any jurisdiction, which only the CCP has access to and only the CCP regulates.

DeepSeek, on the other hand, did exactly what OpenAI has been doing since its inception. ChatGPT is a slop generator trained on everything ever created, and now somebody in China did a better and cheaper slop generator - and gave it away for free.

This was actually the stated goal of OpenAI back when they claimed to be non-profit. This was exactly what they said they wanted to do, and this is the only reason why everyone kind of ignored the fact they stole training data in the first place.

Well, OpenAI somehow decided to become for-profit, and now a Chinese company finished the mission.

It’s an identical product but made more efficient, and accessible to anyone - which is exactly why OpenAI has been pointless company literally overnight.

And yes, DeepSeek is censored to comply with Chinese laws, and yes, the online version is still hosted in China. But you can run it locally, and most people don’t care about the censorship if it does the job, instead of paying any subscription to OpenAI.

So while I’m against TikTok’s shit, I’m totally with the Chinese on this one.

Altman created a knock-off generator, pretended that he can lawyer his way to make it okay by Western standards (it isn’t) - and eventually got out-matched by an even better knock-off generator of knock-offs from China. Which is free. And open source.

OpenAI Claims DeepSeek Plagiarized. Its Plagiarism Machine.,"I'd be going a slightly different route to that, but you have the right conclusion. The use of copyrighted works in AI models is probably *not* copyright infringement—if it were, it'd imply that a lot of very reasonable things are. [Cory Doctorow says it well.](https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/13/spooky-action-at-a-close-up/) It comes down to the point that neither *facts* nor *styles* are copyrightable (and they absolutely *should not* be so).

If a model is trained on your work and then outputs something [substantially similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantial_similarity) to it, that's straightforward copyright infringement. If a model is trained on your work and produces something ""new"", though, it doesn't *matter* if it's using your work as a billionth of its dataset—it's essentially [*de minimis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_minimis) of any individual work, and very likely [fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) if not *de minimis*.

Where it's not okay is the part where an organization can draw from the commons of everyone's works and then privatize their generalization from that without giving anything back to that commons. So … Stable Diffusion models that they give away for free for anyone with a nice computer to run, supported by them selling easy cloud-based generation for the people without nice computers?

OpenAI Claims DeepSeek Plagiarized. Its Plagiarism Machine.,"People who aren't copyright lawyers can know plenty about copyright law. Doctorow is a prominent figure in the free-culture movement. That movement takes copyright *very* seriously; I participate in it via Wikipedia, where the exact bounds of copyright and fair use *matter* because we can only use material that's public domain (not protected by copyright), under a free-content license, or that's fair use in context. [Wikipedia:Non-free content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Non-free_content) is perhaps good reading.

More broadly, read what Doctorow says carefully, because he provides a *variety* of *practical examples* of other sorts of use of copyrighted works that are *clearly* reasonable but that would almost certainly be copyright infringement if we apply the same assumptions that are applied to call model-training infringing. Importantly, Doctorow doesn't *like* AI; the focus here is on holding copyright law to its logical limitations and exceptions as established. I also particularly like Doctorow's thoughtful discussion of AI and copyright in the context of creative labour markets.",

"Microsoft stifling competition in cloud services market, finds UK regulator","The UK antitrust regulator has singled out Microsoft for using its dominance in software to stifle rivals in the £9bn UK cloud services market, as the watchdog warned competition “is not working”.

An independent panel acting for the Competition and Markets Authority said on Tuesday that a lack of competition in cloud services was “likely to be leading to higher costs, less choice, less innovation and lower quality of service for businesses and organisations”.

“Microsoft is using its strong position in software to make it harder for Amazon Web Services and Google to compete effectively for cloud customers that wish to use Microsoft software on the cloud,” the panel said in its provisional decision.

It also recommended the CMA use its new powers under the digital markets regime to decide whether Amazon and Microsoft should receive “strategic market status” as a result of their influence in the area.

Under new legislation, which came into force this month, the UK regulator can designate a small group of companies as having such status and impose certain conduct requirements to try to increase competition.

The decision comes as the CMA is under intense pressure from the government to show it is promoting growth, as Labour attempts to increase business investment in the UK. In an unexpected move last week, CMA chair Marcus Bokkerink was ousted by business secretary Jonathan Reynolds and replaced with former Amazon UK head Doug Gurr.

Writing in the Financial Times on Tuesday, Gurr said the agency would look to speed up its investigations to try to unlock greater investment in the country and bring in greater sector expertise so that businesses did not have to waste time educating the regulator about the industry.

The cloud services investigation has been continuing in various forms for more than two years. Ofcom opened a market study in October 2022 and published an interim report before referring it to the CMA a year later.

The CMA inquiry group said a general lack of competition was interfering with customers’ ability “to switch cloud provider or use multiple clouds, which may ultimately impact the price and quality of cloud services”.

Amazon and Microsoft are the two largest providers of cloud services, each with a share of up to 40 per cent of UK customer spend, followed by Google.

Rima Alaily, Microsoft’s deputy general counsel and head of its competition law group, said in a statement that the report “should be focused on paving the way for the UK’s AI-powered future, not fixating on legacy products launched in the last century”.

“The cloud computing market has never been so dynamic and competitive, attracting billions in investments, new entrants and rapid innovation. What could be better for UK businesses and government?” added Alaily. 

Amazon Web Services said the CMA’s proposed intervention was “not warranted” and urged the agency to “carefully consider how regulatory intervention in other areas will stifle innovation and ultimately harm customers in the UK”.

“The evidence demonstrates the IT services industry is highly competitive,” AWS said. “Cloud computing has lowered costs for UK businesses with on-demand services and pay-as-you-go pricing, expanded product choice, and increased competition and innovation.”

Chris Lindsay, Google Cloud’s vice-president for customer engineering in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said: “Restrictive licensing harms UK cloud customers, threatens economic progress and stifles innovation, and we are encouraged that the CMA has recognised the harm of these practices.”

The CMA must publish a final decision by August 4.",

AI haters build tarpits to trap and trick AI scrapers that ignore robots.txt | Attackers explain how an anti-spam defense became an AI weapon,"Some of the more interesting highlights:

>Shortly after he noticed Facebook's crawler exceeding 30 million hits on his site, Aaron began plotting a new kind of attack on crawlers ""clobbering"" websites that he told Ars he hoped would give ""teeth"" to robots.txt.
>
>Building on an anti-spam cybersecurity tactic known as tarpitting, he created Nepenthes, malicious software named after a carnivorous plant that will ""eat just about anything that finds its way inside.""
>
>Aaron clearly warns users that Nepenthes is aggressive malware. It's not to be deployed by site owners uncomfortable with trapping AI crawlers and sending them down an ""infinite maze"" of static files with no exit links, where they ""get stuck"" and ""thrash around"" for months, he tells users. Once trapped, the crawlers can be fed gibberish data, aka Markov babble, which is designed to poison AI models. That's likely an appealing bonus feature for any site owners who, like Aaron, are fed up with paying for AI scraping and just want to watch AI burn.
>
>Tarpits were originally designed to waste spammers' time and resources, but creators like Aaron have now evolved the tactic into an anti-AI weapon. As of this writing, Aaron confirmed that Nepenthes can effectively trap all the major web crawlers. So far, only OpenAI's crawler has managed to escape.
>
>...
>
>""We’re aware of efforts to disrupt AI web crawlers,"" OpenAI's spokesperson said. ""We design our systems to be resilient while respecting robots.txt and standard web practices.""
>
>But to Aaron, the fight is not about winning. Instead, it's about resisting the AI industry further decaying the Internet with tech that no one asked for, like chatbots that replace customer service agents or the rise of inaccurate AI search summaries. By releasing Nepenthes, he hopes to do as much damage as possible, perhaps spiking companies' AI training costs, dragging out training efforts, or even accelerating model collapse, with tarpits helping to delay the next wave of enshittification.
>
>...
>
>It's hard to tell how widely Nepenthes has been deployed. Site owners are discouraged from flagging when the malware has been deployed, forcing crawlers to face unknown ""consequences"" if they ignore robots.txt instructions.
>
>...
>
>Already blocking scraping and attempting to poison AI models through a simpler method, Nagy took his defense method further and created his own tarpit, Iocaine. He told Ars the tarpit immediately killed off about 94 percent of bot traffic to his site, which was primarily from AI crawlers. Soon, social media discussion drove users to inquire about Iocaine deployment, including not just individuals but also organizations wanting to take stronger steps to block scraping.
>
>Iocaine takes ideas (not code) from Nepenthes, but it's more intent on using the tarpit to poison AI models. Nagy used a reverse proxy to trap crawlers in an ""infinite maze of garbage"" in an attempt to slowly poison their data collection as much as possible for daring to ignore robots.txt.
>
>...
>
>""Any time one of these crawlers pulls from my tarpit, it's resources they've consumed and will have to pay hard cash for, but, being bullshit, the money [they] have spent to get it won't be paid back by revenue,"" Aaron posted, explaining his tactic online. ""It effectively raises their costs. And seeing how none of them have turned a profit yet, that's a big problem for them. The investor money will not continue forever without the investors getting paid.""
>
>...
>
>To Geuter, a computer scientist who has been writing about the social, political, and structural impact of tech for two decades, AI is the ""most aggressive"" example of ""technologies that are not done 'for us' but 'to us.'""
>
>""It feels a bit like the social contract that society and the tech sector/engineering have had (you build useful things, and we're OK with you being well-off) has been canceled from one side,"" Geuter said. ""And that side now wants to have its toy eat the world. People feel threatened and want the threats to stop.""
>
>As AI evolves, so do attacks, with one 2021 study showing that increasingly stronger data poisoning attacks, for example, were able to break data sanitization defenses. Whether these attacks can ever do meaningful destruction or not, Geuter sees tarpits as a ""powerful symbol"" of the resistance that Aaron and Nagy readily joined.
>
>""It's a great sign to see that people are challenging the notion that we all have to do AI now,"" Geuter said. ""Because we don't. It's a choice. A choice that mostly benefits monopolists.""

It was pretty interesting to read about these efforts to resist scraping by various companies and ignoring the robots.txt files in place. If widespread, then this would indicate that the social agreement to respect these files by webcrawlers is no longer effective, and that unfortunately more stringent measures might be required.",

Trump’s new head of DOT rips up US fuel efficiency regulations | Secretary Duffy claims polluting more will make cars cheaper.,"Just FYI- cafe standards are part of the reason there are no small pickups in america. The current emissions standards for pickups are based on MPG to wheelbase ratio, so the flying brick has to be bigger to avoid fines. Of course, the other side of that equation is that the manufacturers don't want to pay those fines. A quick google says it's $14 per 0.1 MPG over times the number of vehicles sold for pickups (I'm trusting the ai overview here).

This is one place where I think some rethinking has to be done. I don't think this is the team to do it, and I don't think that just ripping the band-aid off is the way to go about it.

Also, manufacturers usually spend like ten years doing R&D for a new model, so I doubt they're going to jump right in to production just because this standard has changed dramatically overnight, seeing as the next administration (please let there be a next administration) might put the standards right back.

It's possible that GM might import some small daihatsus or suzukis, but then, if the standards go back, these trucks will either be forced into off highway vehicle status or grandfathered in with some sort of exemption.

Trump’s new head of DOT rips up US fuel efficiency regulations | Secretary Duffy claims polluting more will make cars cheaper.,"Idk the details of this (I am sure it has some other consequences from incompetence like much of Trump admin changes) but US regulation is why we have bigger cars/trucks then the rest of the world. Corporate Average Fuel Economy  [ CAFE] standards have a loophole for 'light trucks' which allows them to have a lower mpg average requirement then normal cars. This loophole was expanded during the bush era to tie mpg requirements to  a vehicle physical size. Basically the bigger the vehicle the lower the mpg requirement which resulted in Us car manufacturers building bigger cars to avoid mpg requirements.

Normally I would be on board with revising this regulation as it is not doing what it intended. Instead of focusing on building fuel efficient cars manufacturers focus on building bigger cars with lower mpg requirements meaning we are selling more less efficient vehicles. It needs a rework. 

Yet I don't trust this admin to do it correctly. If I understand correctly this basically removes regulations, it doesn't refactor them to be better. So now car manufacturers can sell both big and even less fuel efficient vehicles. My only hope here is that car manufacturers not really utilizing this as it is likely to revert back to being regulated the second Dems retake power (if that even happens :( )",

They absolutely already do this. More often than you think.

And it's not just cars, its also motorcycles.

A good example is the CA/CARB version of Harley vs the rest of the 49States version of the bike. the CA/CARB version has emissions hardware and different tunes and stuff like that to meet CARB.

The rest of the same model sold elsewhere/outside the EU will not have this hardware. Instead they have more aggressive tunes and simply do not install the emissions control(except the Cat converter). Despite this the bikes are still actually Euro5 compliant and are really clean engines.

This is not unique to HD and pretty much everyone does it because Cali's economy is so big and powerful and worth selling in.

There are literally millions of cars in the USA and bikes too, that could not be sold in California but can still be sold in Europe(euro5 compliant).",

Trump’s new head of DOT rips up US fuel efficiency regulations | Secretary Duffy claims polluting more will make cars cheaper.,"Yeah CAFE regs are an utter disaster for the environment and safety. There's been very little innovation in actual emissions because the loophole is ""just make everything 6000 pounds+"" and small cars that polluted less in the 90s don't exist outside of the MX-5.

Instead we're wasting metal and plastic on monstrous subway train sized SUVs and pickups that carry single occupants. They're so huge that pedestrian injuries and deaths have rocketed up in the past several years, because hoodlines are 5ft now. My uncle was killed this Thanksgiving from a hit and run by a massive pickup. You can't survive in cars either, NHTSA regs mean shit when you're hit by an 8,000 pickup drinking and driving or texting, no matter how good your crash safety rating is. We need to start having safety regs that emphasize protecting other people and cars instead of only the occupants in your own vehicle.

There's a reason imported japanese kei trucks are wildly popular, because they're small, reliable, and cheap and do 90% of the job of a full size pickup (sans towing, but over 75% of pickup owners never tow). They became so popular that they're being banned state by state by the dealership lobby because they're eating into pickup sales. 

I hate Shitler and Edolf at the core of my being but dismantling CAFE was the one thing I hoped they do, given it was an Obama era reg (and Shitler is determined to undo everything Obama did). We won't get better emissions regs out of it, but hopefully we'll see the return of small cars and pickup again.",

To further humiliate them, the project is open source and released by China of all places. You don't like that the model is spitting out gov psyop or some backdoor in the code? The code is public! Go to github, clone the project, inspect the code, and maybe retrain it. The project is open source.

Also afaik, using the output of a model as training data is common practice in machine learning, so idk what's the big deal here.

Moreover, Open AI, a non profit that plans to turn into a for profit with ties to the military industrial complex, trained their model on copyrighted materials that may have been without consent. So uhm, they're whining someone did the same thing to them? I find the hypocrisy amusing

A typical example is a conversation about an issue. Men will tend to focus on fixing the problem, giving advice - offering a tool. While women will tend to focus on listening and empathizing, offering their support.

I'd normally write this off as another person who doesn't understand the words they've heard smarter people use, but I'm waiting on my coffee so I'll give you the time.

So lets break it down.

>*At least the chat doesn't ignore them*

>*Might be their personality. Maybe a therapist would be a better use of their time.*

The original joke is met with the admonition that maybe those men deserve to be ignored. But it goes on:

>*There's too many men raised by ""boy moms"" and dads who dont think they need to ""raise"" children who told them how special they were*

Here we have the wedging of personal grievances. Which is fine, whatever, but it doesn't make sense. As I noted with my comment:

>*You'll notice basically all of them have some top level variation on ""a girl complimented me once and I've thought about it for the last 6 years.""*

Which is, generally speaking, not the behavior of a cohort that is being lathered in reinforcement and to whom life treats as a special prince.

Does that help?

To maybe scaffold the larger dialogue for you, the thing that both you and the other commenter are missing from the male experience (you are both women, I'm guessing?) is that you are confusing *apathy* for *favoritism*.

The world, largely, does not care about men; [certainly not when there is an opportunity to care about women instead](https://x.com/Try2StopME/status/1588727702932303873). Even parents are less protective of male children. The ""lack of parenting"" you are referring to may seem nice when as a child you are yourself being structured more (obviously the envy carries to this day) but another nearer word would be ""neglect."" And that doesn't end in childhood, it carries forward for our entire lives.",

"ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says",Men as a whole are not bad. Some people are raised terribly and become bad because they do not have the drive to be a better person once on their own. A patriarchal society makes men the most notable example because they are the most visible and have more control in society. This is why people say toxic masculinity hurts men. Having some advantages in society does not translate to personal relationships and causes confusion,
"ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says","With all due respect, it's an interesting perspective, but these ingrained tendencies begin _much_ earlier—long before anything is 'marketed' to children or young people. Statistically, as they grow up, men show greater interest in moving parts, functioning machines, and, more broadly, 'objects and tools,' regardless of the higher purpose those objects might serve or any adverts targeted towards them. Can designing be made more appealing to women later on? Probably. But this won't compensate for the deep-seated, instinctive drivers that steer men in this direction from early childhood—at least not on a societal level. The same could be said in reverse for many careers and activities that tend to be more attractive to women.",

"Memes spread conspiracy theories by uniting online groups, shows new research","A new study finds a sinister side to memes, pointing to their role in strengthening online communities of conspiracy theorists.

Shared photos and videos that reinforce a ‘conspiracist worldview’ have a role in building a sense of tribalism and collective opinion within online conspiracy theorist communities, according to researchers from the University of Bath’s School of Management.

The study breaks new ground by analysing the cultural role of memes in online conspiracy communities, published in the journal Social Media + Society.

PhD researcher Emily Godwin, from Bath’s Institute for Digital Security and Behaviour (IDSB), said: “We see from this study that memes play a significant role in reinforcing the culture of online conspiracy theorist communities. Members gravitate towards memes that validate their ‘conspiracist worldview’, and these memes become an important part of their storytelling. Their simple, shareable format then enables the rapid spread of harmful beliefs.”

  
Using data from Reddit, a widely used discussion platform and a hotspot for conspiracy theories, the researchers analysed 544 memes across two interconnected subreddits about Covid-19 between 2020 and 2022: r/NoNewNormal (r/NNN), which was banned by Reddit in September 2021; and r/CoronavirusCirclejerk (r/CvCj).

Memes were found to fall into three broad themes within the online conspiracy theory community: ‘deception’ by authorities and conspirators; ‘delusion’ among the public; and ‘superiority’ of conspiracy believers who see themselves as committed to ‘free thinking’.",

If China is suddenly seen as completely owning both the future of tech as well as current manufacturing capability, it would seem like a safer place to store capital in spite of the authoritarian behavior that caused investors to flee China over the last couple of years. This would be EXTREMELY bad for everyone in the US, not just tech investors, who would probably be much better off than the rest of America. Americans have not had real problems the last couple of decades the way the rest of the (developing) world has, and now we think moral problems outweigh material ones. 

Your last statement is just vague hand waving. It isn’t guaranteed nor does it matter if AI would avoid such an outcome, the investment bubble collapsing would absolutely cause it.",

Headed for technofascism’: the rightwing roots of Silicon Valley,"[remember this from last year?](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1cdj0rd/the_tech_baron_seeking_to_ethnically_cleanse_san/) a tech bro CEO got on the news and multiple subs for his batshit insane ideas that involved solving ""wokeness"" by targeting ""rich white males"" in America and having Americans wear color coded shirts based on their political affiliation for easy segregation?

And saying tech bros need a promised land to make their own because they were chosen ones?

And most other tech bros were saying he was a hyper genius, a machine gun of good ideas?

Mental illness, insecurity, and money do not mix. Its clear from how these men talk they are bitter they werent the jock in high school. Thats why they are all about Masculinity now.

Headed for technofascism’: the rightwing roots of Silicon Valley,"I think people are overthinking it, it's about money.  They are all sociopaths that's how they get where they are.

Modern ""tech"" had lots of free capital through investment on the assumption that it will pay off in the long run.  That lasted a LONG time and you could pump money into all sorts of stupid shit.

That dried up.  Now to keep making profit they need to reduce costs, optimize and reduce opex.  To do that, you need to cut cut cut.  Cut free food, cut health benefits, cut wages, etc...  but what you can't cut is profit and shareholder value / CEO returns.

Headed for technofascism’: the rightwing roots of Silicon Valley,"Yea it’s a weird subculture to say the least. 

I think they are all falling into the trap of information - they believe in the austere worldview that more information is better and that we should ignore all of humanity for the past few thousand years and go merely by this or that specific information I have.  

It’s often an extreme libertarian view with the additions of data driven concepts.  

Personally I do think more information is better and follow a worldview that we should go via information.  But I also think human systems intuitive understand certain concepts of organization and that democracy / freedom of input from many sources is most important.  

In the techno-libertarian worldview - we should steamroll society to mold it into what we feel our data says. Which is meaningless and dangerous - the data mostly comes from the disaggregated and free society and that’s how it’s most useful.  Once u corrupt the freedom of that information source it becomes hard to manage outcomes or have a working society. 

I almost feel this is a human form of the information problem that AI encounters - feed the same information in continuously and it will just disintegrate in its usefulness.  

I wish the tech bro culture could realize that the information system and it’s freedom are what’s really important and as much as any people begin actively working to corrupt that freedom (say by affecting major social media platforms / making their voice the loudest in the room / pontificating about forcing people to their worldview) they start to destroy the entirety of the information system",
Headed for technofascism’: the rightwing roots of Silicon Valley,That's what exclusively STEM education does to you.,
Headed for technofascism’: the rightwing roots of Silicon Valley,No they were always right wing.,
Headed for technofascism’: the rightwing roots of Silicon Valley,"Some offshoots of this is that 

(1) education is most important as you need the most disaggregated and best information processing systems amongst your society
(2) democracy is important to allow disaggregated information handling for decision purposes 
(3) free markets and anti-monopolies are another form of protecting economic information systems. Insomuch as more economic resources are consolidated to a few corporates - the information system breaks down 
(4) respecting differing views is important because group think or loudly overshadowing other view again destroys the information system
(5) utilizing psychological tactics to corrupt individuals thought processes becomes counter productive as it again removes freedom of thought and processing within that system. 

I often note that even a philosopher king would fail because once a system becomes too limited in information gathering and processing - it becomes harder and harder to manage chaotic systems. There isn’t enough freedom in the processing and gathering of information for society to operate optimally.",
Headed for technofascism’: the rightwing roots of Silicon Valley,"I don't think its that, I think its more that they haven't had any form of social interaction with a normal person in a decade plus",
Headed for technofascism’: the rightwing roots of Silicon Valley,Yes. Liberals are right wing.,
Headed for technofascism’: the rightwing roots of Silicon Valley,But it is definitely also that. They are so easily swayed by juvenile ideas that would have been addressed in humanities 101.,
Headed for technofascism’: the rightwing roots of Silicon Valley,"There is a point in that studying STEM exclusively cultivates a positivist and essentialist worldview that leaves little room for the ambiguity or subjectivity that are innate elements of our human condition, while the humanities excel at exploring and providing tools to negotiate these more nuanced aspects of existence.  It’s why the humanities are more equipped to cultivate empathy (And partially why they’re loathed and discredited by the right wing) because the humanities ask students to project themselves and their thinking onto other people’s lived experiences as a means of understanding this diverse existence - and that threatens any attempt to establish a singular hierarchical order. Thus we hear the hysteria that liberal arts departments in universities are indoctrinating a kind of “Cultural Marxism”; or “Wokism” but it’s really just people learning about other histories and being open and sympathetic to diversity; that the world has contexts. While STEM is reductionist in that it boils everything down to a solvable problem if we can only burrow down deep enough we can discover some kind universal “truth”.  We’ve done a great disservice to young people by ignoring the humanities imo. They’re equally important to a well rounded education.",
Headed for technofascism’: the rightwing roots of Silicon Valley,Why not both sir planck?,
Headed for technofascism’: the rightwing roots of Silicon Valley,Oddly when you look at the two extremes they’re both non-politically “conservative” in their own rational,
Headed for technofascism’: the rightwing roots of Silicon Valley,"Far right of both the MAGA and libertarian flavors are both right wing in that they seek to protect and entrench established hierarchies and dislike democratization.  Whether its government hierarchy or corporate hierarchy or gender role based family hierarchy, its the root of their philosophy.

To be left wing you have to want to democratize and flatten hierarchies.  Liberals are right wing because they like the hierarchies but think they can use enough band aids in the form of some public goods and investment and cycling of hierarchy leaders that hierarchies aren't a bad thing",
Headed for technofascism’: the rightwing roots of Silicon Valley,"Ah ok, so ""left wing"" has a specific definition, and that means ""right wing"" is *everyone else that doesn't perfectly fit that definition.* You're in, or you're *out*.

That explains the goddamn mess we're in right now, because Harris and Trump look identical to you.",
Headed for technofascism’: the rightwing roots of Silicon Valley,"No, i described the two definitions based on their original coining during the french revolution where the french left toppled the monarchy and attempted to democratize.  They are a spectrum whose understanding was developed by early industrial era political economists.  No, Kamala and Trump are not identical, but yes they can both be accurately described as right wing based on their defense of existing hierarchies and resistance to further democratization - they can both do that while having different policy preferences within the spectrum",

Truly crashing these stocks would be detrimental to the entire American economy.

Americans have this sense of always being the most powerful, innovative, and influential country in the world because in all our lifetimes, we always have been.

Meanwhile, we’re all the most divided we’ve ever been, spending all our time and energy fighting each other and swindling consumers into paying every cent they possibly can for every product before they all start literally starving. We’ve pushed Capitalism to its limit and this is the result - a system where profits are the only thing that matters, and the appearance of innovation is more valuable than actual innovation.

Alibaba releases AI model it says surpasses DeepSeek,"The paradox doesnt inherantly have to do with energy consumption, its about generalized demand, where the cost of a resource being used dropping causes demand to increase. We've definitely see this with AI. Image generation was initially locked behind API calls with DALL-E. Release of open source models like Stable Diffusion made the practice far more common as people could run it on their own PCs. As more and more streamlined and distilled models reduced system requirments (especially VRAM counts) you saw it become even more common, to the point more websites could host them and eventually even be hosted locally on smartphones.

To be honest, JP wasn't exactly what I was getting at with that comment. Its moreso the actual optimizations made by Deepseek can also be applied to bigger models in the first place. So it's release could in the long term increase NVIDIA demand by both:

1) Letting more smaller groups host and train their own models.

2) Having big companies still building big models, now using what what they learned from R1.",

"Let's use an LLM to ponder this irony.

""There is a nuanced aspect to this topic that often goes unnoticed. The practice of AI companies utilizing publicly available data to develop new large language models is distinctly different from an AI company using another company's large language model to create their own. While both practices are open to debate, they are not identical.
The distinction lies in the source and ownership of the data being used to create large language models (LLMs).

When AI companies utilize publicly available data, they are drawing from a wide range of sources that are generally accessible to anyone. This practice raises ethical and legal questions about the use of publicly available content, but it doesn't involve appropriating the specific work or intellectual property of another company.

On the other hand, when one AI company uses another company's LLM to create their own, it directly involves leveraging the proprietary work of another entity. This practice raises additional concerns about intellectual property rights, competitive fairness, and potential violations of licensing agreements. Essentially, the first scenario deals with the broader use of public data, while the second involves the use of a competitor’s specific, proprietary technology.""",

"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz allegedly has one. So, too, does Green Party co-chair Franziska Brantner. A multi-million-dollar villa in California.

Scholz, according to the narrative, owns a choice estate in the Hollywood Hills – or did, at least, until it was burned down in the fires. That, at least, was the claim espoused by a recent video, complete with aerial shots of a spectacular mansion.

Many videos currently circulating on social media channels, particularly TikTok, are reinforcing a popular cliché: namely that those at the top earn millions and betray the interests of ordinary people.

The problem, though, is that the videos are complete and utter fabrications.

Russian-Produced Fakes On Elon Musk’s channel X, a clip is circulating showing a uniformed police officer who introduces himself as Cameron. He says he is happy he works in the United Kingdom and not in Germany. According to information received by his agency, he says, a series of major terrorist attacks are being prepared in Germany during the country’s snap parliamentary elections in February. ""Share this video with your friends and family,"" he says.

This video, too, is a fake, likely produced in Russia. The creators took clips from real videos and, as the activists from the fake-news awareness group Antibot4Navalny learned, then used artificial intelligence to distort the voices.

The internet is currently full of countless other manipulations, all with a single goal: to trigger chaos and uncertainty ahead of German elections in an effort to strengthen the political fringes.

  
The attacks aren’t just coming from the east, but also from the west, from the U.S., the erstwhile beacon of freedom and democracy. Elon Musk, the wealthiest man in the world and the owner of both X and Tesla, a man who has developed an almost manic interest in German politics of late, has become a new heavyweight distributor of disinformation. He recently livestreamed a bizarre discussion on X with Alice Weidel, the head of the radical right-wing party Alternative for Germany (AfD) and has repeatedly encouraged voters to back extremist parties. He has also used X to disseminate conspiracy theories designed to boost the fortunes of right-wing populist and right-wing extremist parties around the world",

"Good article. Summary:

The market overreacted to DeepSeek’s AI advancements, wiping out $1 trillion in stock value despite the fact that efficiency gains in AI are expected. DeepSeek’s release doesn’t fundamentally change the landscape; AI demand remains insatiable, and major infrastructure investments are still needed. Concerns about China “catching up” are misplaced, as its capabilities were already well known. The real challenge is AI inference, where efficiency matters most. DeepSeek may be useful, but AI companies will still require billions in investment. Nvidia’s dominance could be challenged, but a radical shift remains unlikely.",

its a cheap knock off that required the expensive ones.  it works for regular people but more in depth tasks require the big guns and if you want to further develop the cheap shit you gotta still develop the expensive shit. so the costs are the same as expensive ones since they had to piggy back off to make a rip off.  Otherwise they would of existed 10 years ago already.,

If true, that would open the door to purpose-built LLM models, like a game company wanting to use AI for its NPC dialogue could train it entirely on in-world lore and text, and have a model which could never randomly start talking about real-world things (as current ones are wont to do).

It’s as if ChatGPT is a sculptor copying a scene of human models, taking weeks to carve marble into a statue. Sure, on one level, people are upset the marble statues aren’t humanity but instead emulations gleaned from humanity.

But if DeepSeek can produce the same statue in a few days, that efficiency is big news in the sculpting world. Except now, it seems DeepSeek is a sculptor who was only able to do that by taking a mold of GPT’s finished marble statue.

Dismissing GPT for being derivative of human works misses the meat of the implication. But US AI firms are definitely mad as hell and I’m slow to accept their claims about DeepSeek, for sure.",

This is correct,
"I don’t think it’s the same thing.

TikTok is not a media company, it does not exist to sell you advertising, its sole purpose is to train the algorithm and use short videos to create data points.

TikTok doesn’t give a fuck about “creators”, it is carefully curated to keep all the non-entertaining stuff off the platform, and it will never cram ads in between videos, because it wants the experience to be seamless for guinea pigs i.e. users.

(It’s also the reason why even when platforms like YouTube or Facebook try imitating TikTok they can never be as successful at it. Because TikTok isn’t about short videos.)

And all the data it gathers ends up on Chinese servers outside of any jurisdiction, which only the CCP has access to and only the CCP regulates.

DeepSeek, on the other hand, did exactly what OpenAI has been doing since its inception. ChatGPT is a slop generator trained on everything ever created, and now somebody in China did a better and cheaper slop generator - and gave it away for free.

This was actually the stated goal of OpenAI back when they claimed to be non-profit. This was exactly what they said they wanted to do, and this is the only reason why everyone kind of ignored the fact they stole training data in the first place.

Well, OpenAI somehow decided to become for-profit, and now a Chinese company finished the mission.

It’s an identical product but made more efficient, and accessible to anyone - which is exactly why OpenAI has been pointless company literally overnight.

And yes, DeepSeek is censored to comply with Chinese laws, and yes, the online version is still hosted in China. But you can run it locally, and most people don’t care about the censorship if it does the job, instead of paying any subscription to OpenAI.

So while I’m against TikTok’s shit, I’m totally with the Chinese on this one.

Altman created a knock-off generator, pretended that he can lawyer his way to make it okay by Western standards (it isn’t) - and eventually got out-matched by an even better knock-off generator of knock-offs from China. Which is free. And open source.

What’s not to love about that.",
*gasp* not the ToS,
What does it change? The whole AI industry is functioning only thanks to theft. Everything stays the same.,
"If your model uses public data to train, the model should be open source, period, end of.",
"I'd be going a slightly different route to that, but you have the right conclusion. The use of copyrighted works in AI models is probably *not* copyright infringement—if it were, it'd imply that a lot of very reasonable things are. [Cory Doctorow says it well.](https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/13/spooky-action-at-a-close-up/) It comes down to the point that neither *facts* nor *styles* are copyrightable (and they absolutely *should not* be so).

If a model is trained on your work and then outputs something [substantially similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantial_similarity) to it, that's straightforward copyright infringement. If a model is trained on your work and produces something ""new"", though, it doesn't *matter* if it's using your work as a billionth of its dataset—it's essentially [*de minimis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_minimis) of any individual work, and very likely [fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) if not *de minimis*.

Where it's not okay is the part where an organization can draw from the commons of everyone's works and then privatize their generalization from that without giving anything back to that commons. So … Stable Diffusion models that they give away for free for anyone with a nice computer to run, supported by them selling easy cloud-based generation for the people without nice computers? That seems largely reasonable to me … okay, minus all the abuse by the incompetent and malicious. OpenAI models where they charge a hefty price tag for ongoing use and hoard the models? Not okay, plus has the *same* problem of use by idiots.",
So? deepseek didnt copy OpenAi's source code and microsoft isn't alleging that. So it's not plagiarism either way. Why do people like you who have no idea about ML and code always want to weigh in.,

How so? (The DEI bit),
"I wouldn't say I'm ""rooting"" for them, but the last week and a half in particular have led me to reconsider whether China is this country's biggest concern right now.",
Wrong time though.,
"But even if Deepseek couldn’t be trained without a teacher model, that still means another, probably American, company can take OpenAI’s output and train their own model at a fraction of the cost. 

That means the moment OpenAI’s models are exposed to the outside world, it will have limited time until every one of its competitors are caught up, which might very well mean that 500b investment into it is useless.",
"Nope. I personally don't use it(or any AI), but the fact that it is free removes any moral obligation to care.",
Why should they?  Anyone can download it for free and run it on their own server if they want to have complete control.,

>But when such a great artist in words, as Joyce undoubtedly is, seeks to draw a **true picture** of the lower middle class in a European city, **ought it to be impossible for the American public legally to see that picture**?

If so much of the cultural world around us exists (which we experience whether we want to or not) in the form of copyrighted slogans, logos, characters, stories, etc.—any accurate relation of that experience *must include those things*. I do not understand any argument that an LLM accurately portraying a picture of the world as it is (or an imaginative variant of it), copyright & all, as any different.

The argument usually comes down to who is getting paid for what, & my conclusion from all of that is that capitalists are claiming ownership of things that ought to be public,.

"People who aren't copyright lawyers can know plenty about copyright law. Doctorow is a prominent figure in the free-culture movement. That movement takes copyright *very* seriously; I participate in it via Wikipedia, where the exact bounds of copyright and fair use *matter* because we can only use material that's public domain (not protected by copyright), under a free-content license, or that's fair use in context. [Wikipedia:Non-free content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Non-free_content) is perhaps good reading.

More broadly, read what Doctorow says carefully, because he provides a *variety* of *practical examples* of other sorts of use of copyrighted works that are *clearly* reasonable but that would almost certainly be copyright infringement if we apply the same assumptions that are applied to call model-training infringing.

"The UK antitrust regulator has singled out Microsoft for using its dominance in software to stifle rivals in the £9bn UK cloud services market, as the watchdog warned competition “is not working”.

An independent panel acting for the Competition and Markets Authority said on Tuesday that a lack of competition in cloud services was “likely to be leading to higher costs, less choice, less innovation and lower quality of service for businesses and organisations”.

“Microsoft is using its strong position in software to make it harder for Amazon Web Services and Google to compete effectively for cloud customers that wish to use Microsoft software on the cloud,” the panel said in its provisional decision.

It also recommended the CMA use its new powers under the digital markets regime to decide whether Amazon and Microsoft should receive “strategic market status” as a result of their influence in the area.

Under new legislation, which came into force this month, the UK regulator can designate a small group of companies as having such status and impose certain conduct requirements to try to increase competition.

The decision comes as the CMA is under intense pressure from the government to show it is promoting growth, as Labour attempts to increase business investment in the UK. In an unexpected move last week, CMA chair Marcus Bokkerink was ousted by business secretary Jonathan Reynolds and replaced with former Amazon UK head Doug Gurr.

Writing in the Financial Times on Tuesday, Gurr said the agency would look to speed up its investigations to try to unlock greater investment in the country and bring in greater sector expertise so that businesses did not have to waste time educating the regulator about the industry.

The cloud services investigation has been continuing in various forms for more than two years. Ofcom opened a market study in October 2022 and published an interim report before referring it to the CMA a year later.

The CMA inquiry group said a general lack of competition was interfering with customers’ ability “to switch cloud provider or use multiple clouds, which may ultimately impact the price and quality of cloud services”.

Amazon and Microsoft are the two largest providers of cloud services, each with a share of up to 40 per cent of UK customer spend, followed by Google.

Rima Alaily, Microsoft’s deputy general counsel and head of its competition law group, said in a statement that the report “should be focused on paving the way for the UK’s AI-powered future, not fixating on legacy products launched in the last century”.

“The cloud computing market has never been so dynamic and competitive, attracting billions in investments, new entrants and rapid innovation. What could be better for UK businesses and government?” added Alaily. 

Amazon Web Services said the CMA’s proposed intervention was “not warranted” and urged the agency to “carefully consider how regulatory intervention in other areas will stifle innovation and ultimately harm customers in the UK”.

“The evidence demonstrates the IT services industry is highly competitive,” AWS said. “Cloud computing has lowered costs for UK businesses with on-demand services and pay-as-you-go pricing, expanded product choice, and increased competition and innovation.”

Chris Lindsay, Google Cloud’s vice-president for customer engineering in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said: “Restrictive licensing harms UK cloud customers, threatens economic progress and stifles innovation, and we are encouraged that the CMA has recognised the harm of these practices.”

The CMA must publish a final decision by August 4.",

>Shortly after he noticed Facebook's crawler exceeding 30 million hits on his site, Aaron began plotting a new kind of attack on crawlers ""clobbering"" websites that he told Ars he hoped would give ""teeth"" to robots.txt.
>
>Building on an anti-spam cybersecurity tactic known as tarpitting, he created Nepenthes, malicious software named after a carnivorous plant that will ""eat just about anything that finds its way inside.""
>
>Aaron clearly warns users that Nepenthes is aggressive malware. It's not to be deployed by site owners uncomfortable with trapping AI crawlers and sending them down an ""infinite maze"" of static files with no exit links, where they ""get stuck"" and ""thrash around"" for months, he tells users. Once trapped, the crawlers can be fed gibberish data, aka Markov babble, which is designed to poison AI models. That's likely an appealing bonus feature for any site owners who, like Aaron, are fed up with paying for AI scraping and just want to watch AI burn.
>
>Tarpits were originally designed to waste spammers' time and resources, but creators like Aaron have now evolved the tactic into an anti-AI weapon. As of this writing, Aaron confirmed that Nepenthes can effectively trap all the major web crawlers. So far, only OpenAI's crawler has managed to escape.
>
>...
>
>""We’re aware of efforts to disrupt AI web crawlers,"" OpenAI's spokesperson said. ""We design our systems to be resilient while respecting robots.txt and standard web practices.""

>But to Aaron, the fight is not about winning. Instead, it's about resisting the AI industry further decaying the Internet with tech that no one asked for, like chatbots that replace customer service agents or the rise of inaccurate AI search summaries. By releasing Nepenthes, he hopes to do as much damage as possible, perhaps spiking companies' AI training costs, dragging out training efforts, or even accelerating model collapse, with tarpits helping to delay the next wave of enshittification.
>
>...

>Already blocking scraping and attempting to poison AI models through a simpler method, Nagy took his defense method further and created his own tarpit, Iocaine. He told Ars the tarpit immediately killed off about 94 percent of bot traffic to his site, which was primarily from AI crawlers. Soon, social media discussion drove users to inquire about Iocaine deployment, including not just individuals but also organizations wanting to take stronger steps to block scraping.
>
>Iocaine takes ideas (not code) from Nepenthes, but it's more intent on using the tarpit to poison AI models. Nagy used a reverse proxy to trap crawlers in an ""infinite maze of garbage"" in an attempt to slowly poison their data collection as much as possible for daring to ignore robots.txt.

It was pretty interesting to read about these efforts to resist scraping by various companies and ignoring the robots.txt files in place. If widespread, then this would indicate that the social agreement to respect these files by webcrawlers is no longer effective, and that unfortunately more stringent measures might be required.",

"Just FYI- cafe standards are part of the reason there are no small pickups in america. The current emissions standards for pickups are based on MPG to wheelbase ratio, so the flying brick has to be bigger to avoid fines. Of course, the other side of that equation is that the manufacturers don't want to pay those fines. A quick google says it's $14 per 0.1 MPG over times the number of vehicles sold for pickups (I'm trusting the ai overview here).

This is one place where I think some rethinking has to be done. I don't think this is the team to do it, and I don't think that just ripping the band-aid off is the way to go about it.

Also, manufacturers usually spend like ten years doing R&D for a new model, so I doubt they're going to jump right in to production just because this standard has changed dramatically overnight, seeing as the next administration (please let there be a next administration) might put the standards right back.

It's possible that GM might import some small daihatsus or suzukis, but then, if the standards go back, these trucks will either be forced into off highway vehicle status or grandfathered in with some sort of exemption.

"Idk the details of this (I am sure it has some other consequences from incompetence like much of Trump admin changes) but US regulation is why we have bigger cars/trucks then the rest of the world. Corporate Average Fuel Economy  [ CAFE] standards have a loophole for 'light trucks' which allows them to have a lower mpg average requirement then normal cars. This loophole was expanded during the bush era to tie mpg requirements to  a vehicle physical size. Basically the bigger the vehicle the lower the mpg requirement which resulted in Us car manufacturers building bigger cars to avoid mpg requirements.

Normally I would be on board with revising this regulation as it is not doing what it intended. Instead of focusing on building fuel efficient cars manufacturers focus on building bigger cars with lower mpg requirements meaning we are selling more less efficient vehicles. It needs a rework. 

Yet I don't trust this admin to do it correctly. If I understand correctly this basically removes regulations, it doesn't refactor them to be better. So now car manufacturers can sell both big and even less fuel efficient vehicles. My only hope here is that car manufacturers not really utilizing this as it is likely to revert back to being regulated the second Dems retake power (if that even happens :( )",

They do not want to waste the money reversing those only to have them put back in place with the next administration. Automakers are the same way.

"Car companies have already spent a shit ton of money in order to become more efficient and be in line with more strict regulations. They were actually lobbying Trump to keep the strict emissions standards because they’ve already committed and spent too much to go back. They’re not going to reverse course just because Trump says they can. It takes ages to get this stuff ready. And they’re not going to go back now, especially since they have no idea whether the emissions standards will change again in another 4 years. Best to play it safe and mitigate risk. You have to follow the emissions standards of all markets you want to sell in.",

During Trump's previous administration, he attempted to remove California's EPA exemption, [and companies like Toyota supported Trump's legal case](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/automakers-side-with-trump-in-legal-fight-with-california). It was in legal process until the Biden administration who abandoned the effort.

It is almost certain that Trump's new administration will repeat his attempt to revoke California's EPA exemption.",
The catch is this joke of an administration might remove that California carve out. It is pretty clear the current administration does not give a damn about what is legal and the joke of the Roberts court will sign off on it.,

"This. The investments have already been made and they don’t want to scrap them just to be forced to reimplement them later on. Plus making separate cars for their largest domestic market is not cost efficient. Automakers build their vehicle to the most stringent state’s requirements to keep costs down. They aren’t going to build separate cars for California. They’re going to roll out every car to meet California standards. I bought my truck in Iowa and it still meets California standards. 

We’re seeing the same grumbling in the oil industry. They’ve invested massively in the current regulations and don’t want to roll them back when the next administration could reinstate them. 

It’s capitalism and it’s what we claim we want.",
Just look at Zuck. CEOs are running to do what Trump wants even if it's bad for their brand.,

Instead we're wasting metal and plastic on monstrous subway train sized SUVs and pickups that carry single occupants. They're so huge that pedestrian injuries and deaths have rocketed up in the past several years, because hoodlines are 5ft now. My uncle was killed this Thanksgiving from a hit and run by a massive pickup. You can't survive in cars either, NHTSA regs mean shit when you're hit by an 8,000 pickup drinking and driving or texting, no matter how good your crash safety rating is. We need to start having safety regs that emphasize protecting other people and cars instead of only the occupants in your own vehicle.

There's a reason imported japanese kei trucks are wildly popular, because they're small, reliable, and cheap and do 90% of the job of a full size pickup (sans towing, but over 75% of pickup owners never tow). They became so popular that they're being banned state by state by the dealership lobby because they're eating into pickup sales. 

I hate Shitler and Edolf at the core of my being but dismantling CAFE was the one thing I hoped they do, given it was an Obama era reg (and Shitler is determined to undo everything Obama did).

To further humiliate them, the project is open source and released by China of all places. You don't like that the model is spitting out gov psyop or some backdoor in the code? The code is public! Go to github, clone the project, inspect the code, and maybe retrain it. The project is open source.

Also afaik, using the output of a model as training data is common practice in machine learning, so idk what's the big deal here.

Moreover, Open AI, a non profit that plans to turn into a for profit with ties to the military industrial complex, trained their model on copyrighted materials that may have been without consent. So uhm, they're whining someone did the same thing to them? I find the hypocrisy amusing

"As a female ChatGPT user, I can report that I use it 100% of the time on my laptop. I don’t even have the app installed on my phone.",
That’s interesting honestly. I am an engineering Student from Asia and my classmates(a lot of them being females) use Chatgpt and Gemini a lot to understand research papers or codes. I am surprised it isnt higher but i guess it makes sense considering it is less common in western countries.,
"Comments in here are so weird. This report isn't surprising at all. Men are more likely to adopt new technology early. The vast majority of AI related tools (besides stuff like Character AI) are gonna be used much more by men. AI, like GPT, is used a lot for programming, engineering, and technical roles, which are more common with men.

It's like looking at the same report if you were to investigate GitHub Discussions or StackOverFlow. They would also mostly be male.

Edit: This very subreddit is likely also very male dominated, for similar reasons.",
70% male are developers 🏳️,
Early tech adopters,

Historically I bet if you look at all major tech in its infancy the user base is about 85% or more male.,

Don't tell the Trump administration. We're 100% male if he starts snooping around.,

Proving that women really ARE smarter than men.,
"I’m a woman and I’m using ChatGPT for a lot of things.  I’m learning how to start my own business doing hydroponics and mushrooms.  I also want to write a book and make a website and ChatGPT is helping me there.  I also use it to make fun pictures and even ask it to illustrate gardening plans and concepts.  I also recently started using it to play text based DnD style games.  I also use it for recipe ideas, menu planning and more!


I’m using DeepSeek too!  I find the technologies to be interesting, easy to use, fun and I enjoy the conversational tone.  Overall, they’re great to use.  I also don’t work in tech.",
"Damn I am seriously in the minority!


I use it almost daily for household junk, finding answers & helping with my actual work, too. Not coding tho. ",
"This comment thread is full of overly sensitive people, who can not accept any basic statistics regarding gender, because they think _everything is somehow some contest between sexes_. So funny to see how easily you can trigger childish redditors by some factual numbers regarding technology and gender. One of my friends organized an event (international programmer olympics for young people) last year. He told me that after the contest they had to cosmeticize some data, because _less than 3 percent of the participants in the finals were female_, and certain groups would somehow find this offensive, lol. Don't be so afraid of facts people!",

"I am a woman and I use ChatGPT for certain tasks at work, helping me with my budget, a weekly “book club,” meal planning/calorie tracking, and sometimes even philosophical discussions. However, for reasons I do not understand, I have yet to sell any of my other girlfriends on how handy I’ve found AI to be in my professional and personal life.",
That makes a lot of sense,
Wow this thread. Not even sure what I expected when clicking in but I should have known better by now,
I know there's that correlation vs causation argument but does this have to do with women finding more success in the current education system? ,
"Men typically take a more systematic approach and are solution-oriented. This leads some people to consider them more object-oriented or to have a deeper appreciation for tools.

Women typically are people-oriented, value communication, shared experience, community-building, and caregiving.

A typical example is a conversation about an issue. Men will tend to focus on fixing the problem, giving advice - offering a tool. While women will tend to focus on listening and empathizing, offering their support. 

These are generalizations, but right now chatGPT offers solutions as a tool, and not much of a personal connection.",
"Yeah so is tech in general, its just how it is.

Edit: the amount of ""antiman"" in here is crazy. If you can't say it about a woman. Without it being offensive,  then it probably shouldn't be said about a man.",
"I'm confused, why does this matter? Like why is representation an issue on something optional/recreational to use? People use it for their own purposes, there's no barrier to that besides having things you need/want to figure out.",
When will chatGPT open their stats on how many requests are porn-related?,
"Maybe because we are a demographic that feels like we can’t talk to anyone about the way we feel without being heavily judged or having it used against us. Chatgpt will listen and respond without being critical of the person, and you can delete the log after.",
"I would assume the same stat for pretty much any tech space. VR usage, active Steam users, active GitHub accounts",
Holy shit y’all are sad,
Using a new tool I don’t really understand and getting disappointed by the results is the most masculine thing I do,

Tons of lonely men turning to AI girlfriends to pacify their emotional needs is not the worst thing

If it staves off desperation and makes people more mindful and patient with the connections they make, that’s a good thing",

Not good for women. They aren't learning to use an extremely powerful tool. Will make them less productive and if it continues too long they will be less desirable employees.,
I've still yet to use it and no plans to try. Fuck Ai.,
This is a natural extension of the poor showing of males in school.,

"Coincidentally, 81% of  injuries from accidental firearm discharge are also men. 65% of fireworks accidents are men as well.

Shocker to nobody,
And why the fuck do they gather this information?,
"Not so surprising. Probably 90% of their regular userbase is IT staff, which as we know is dominated by male.",
I’m curious how they could know that.,
It is a great assistant for people with disabilities like me and my gf. We both use it to help with our lives.,
majority ChatGPT questions are technical nature or stem professions so makes sense,
Is this worldwide? Because Trump made all men in America female via executive order.,
I think women prefer to waste their time with more traditional timewasters like TikTok and Farmville ,
Because 85% of women know they can post up and rely on a man if AI eats their job? 😈,
"This is concerning because your interactions with gpt further inform its knowledge base. With such a high percent of males using it, it will increasingly marginalize women's perspectives. It's also of note that most mobile ""assisstants"" are default female voice. This is a commodification of women and will have dehumanizing effects.",
Makes sense. Women are too focused on being whores and selling their pussies for 5$,
"Ah, so women continue to carry the critical thinking loads. shocking",
How many of those users are AI ?,
Oh no! So what!?!,

Wait until they start trying to assert dominance on ChatGPT.,
This made me chuckle out loud like an idiot.,
They'll start mansplaining to AI.,

What does that even mean?",
"Might be their personality. Maybe a therapist would be a better use of their time.

There's too many men raised by ""boy moms"" and dads who dont think they need to ""raise"" children who told them how special they were without teaching them they have to actually work on themselves and put in effort to their relationships,work, and everyday lives if they want other people to take them seriously",
Underrated comment 😂,

All I ever see people use it for is assignments.,
"I asked in another comment thread, but where is this ""report""?  Am I missing a link to it in the article?  I'm curious how they got this data.

""Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.""",
This sentence was brought to you by meta AI.,
70% of all men are developers? ,
Do you mean developers are 70% male ? There is no way 70% of all men are developers.,
"I'm a male developer, and hate using my phone for most anything. I'm much faster on a real keyboard and large monitor.  Typing on a phone is akin to torture.",

This is a self-report dude.,

Same way various data brokers can ascertain all sorts of information about populations without knowing the specific users by name.,

Edit: why the downvotes?  Nobody's been able to actually answer my question.  Most of you aren't even understanding my question.

I suspect the author of the article just asked ChatGPT for these numbers since they don't provide a source.

Edit 2: FYI, this was the only reference to the ""report"" in the article:  
""Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.""  
So it's some 3rd-party company's ""estimate"" without a link to the data or mention of methodology.",
"Nah, there are a lot of adults.",

"I’d highly suggest you check it out. It’s more embarrassing not to use it at this point. It’s extremely useful as a tutor or teacher. Or as a colleague to bounce ideas off of. It’s not always right, but it really helps you with organizing your own ideas, learning math and science concepts, or even dealing with scenarios in your personal life. As long as you keep in mind it’s a tool which can be wrong, it’s extremely useful.",
Man we are right on track with the story line of Deus Ex prequels. ,
"Aight bro, u don’t need it. No one’s forcing you. Just find the information u need at your local library within the encyclopedia.",
"unironically? a discord server, a reddit community, etc. if you mean something in person, try your local library, or save up to move out.",
Why wouldn't they?  This is pretty much the most basic of user data you can get.,
A female voice is usually more pleasant and calming to listen to. Using a female voice for announcements predates any mobile assistants.,
Wow. What’s with extreme sexism?,
What are you talking about,

Yep I use desktop app at work.,

"There's such a thing as toxic positivity. They get reinforcement from one biased source and cannot comprehend why others do not follow suit. Because the source down plays negative aspects of their personality, they assume they are ""fine"" without acknowledging what is stopping others from giving them attention and positivity 

The men saying they thought about a woman complimenting them likely have gotten positive reinforcement from a parent before. But they aren't getting it outside the home. The fact remains people as a whole are nice and friendly to people who appear safe and friendly to them. If women do not feel secure around you, they will not approach you, for a start. If you do not put yourself in situations where positive feedback is possible, you will not get any, either. If you are negative or aggressive, you will likely be avoided. 

These are men getting reinforcement that's not earned and not understanding no one without a biased interest is going to view them as the same kind of ""special"".

Misandry is literally discrimination against people for something they have no control over and yet people who likely describe themselves as left leaning are fine with it? Makes no sense.,

I'd normally write this off as another person who doesn't understand the words they've heard smarter people use, but I'm waiting on my coffee so I'll give you the time.

So lets break it down.

>*At least the chat doesn't ignore them*

>*Might be their personality. Maybe a therapist would be a better use of their time.*

The original joke is met with the admonition that maybe those men deserve to be ignored. But it goes on:

>*There's too many men raised by ""boy moms"" and dads who dont think they need to ""raise"" children who told them how special they were*

Here we have the wedging of personal grievances. Which is fine, whatever, but it doesn't make sense. As I noted with my comment:

>*You'll notice basically all of them have some top level variation on ""a girl complimented me once and I've thought about it for the last 6 years.""*

Which is, generally speaking, not the behavior of a cohort that is being lathered in reinforcement and to whom life treats as a special prince.

Does that help?

To maybe scaffold the larger dialogue for you, the thing that both you and the other commenter are missing from the male experience (you are both women, I'm guessing?) is that you are confusing *apathy* for *favoritism*.

The world, largely, does not care about men; [certainly not when there is an opportunity to care about women instead](https://x.com/Try2StopME/status/1588727702932303873). Even parents are less protective of male children. The ""lack of parenting"" you are referring to may seem nice when as a child you are yourself being structured more (obviously the envy carries to this day) but another nearer word would be ""neglect."" And that doesn't end in childhood, it carries forward for our entire lives.",

Why do you think women leave men on read? Genuine question. I’m interested in hearing your thoughts.,
Men as a whole are not bad. Some people are raised terribly and become bad because they do not have the drive to be a better person once on their own. A patriarchal society makes men the most notable example because they are the most visible and have more control in society. This is why people say toxic masculinity hurts men. Having some advantages in society does not translate to personal relationships and causes confusion,
"With all due respect, it's an interesting perspective, but these ingrained tendencies begin _much_ earlier—long before anything is 'marketed' to children or young people. Statistically, as they grow up, men show greater interest in moving parts, functioning machines, and, more broadly, 'objects and tools,' regardless of the higher purpose those objects might serve or any adverts targeted towards them. Can designing be made more appealing to women later on? Probably. But this won't compensate for the deep-seated, instinctive drivers that steer men in this direction from early childhood—at least not on a societal level. The same could be said in reverse for many careers and activities that tend to be more attractive to women.",

"A new study finds a sinister side to memes, pointing to their role in strengthening online communities of conspiracy theorists.

Shared photos and videos that reinforce a ‘conspiracist worldview’ have a role in building a sense of tribalism and collective opinion within online conspiracy theorist communities, according to researchers from the University of Bath’s School of Management.

The study breaks new ground by analysing the cultural role of memes in online conspiracy communities, published in the journal Social Media + Society.

PhD researcher Emily Godwin, from Bath’s Institute for Digital Security and Behaviour (IDSB), said: “We see from this study that memes play a significant role in reinforcing the culture of online conspiracy theorist communities. Members gravitate towards memes that validate their ‘conspiracist worldview’, and these memes become an important part of their storytelling. Their simple, shareable format then enables the rapid spread of harmful beliefs.”

  
Using data from Reddit, a widely used discussion platform and a hotspot for conspiracy theories, the researchers analysed 544 memes across two interconnected subreddits about Covid-19 between 2020 and 2022: r/NoNewNormal (r/NNN), which was banned by Reddit in September 2021; and r/CoronavirusCirclejerk (r/CvCj).

Memes were found to fall into three broad themes within the online conspiracy theory community: ‘deception’ by authorities and conspirators; ‘delusion’ among the public; and ‘superiority’ of conspiracy believers who see themselves as committed to ‘free thinking’.",

I’m not saying there’s no limit for what they can or should get away with, nor am I saying that regulations and suits to change company behavior are bad, but your original post was ridiculously hyperbolic and ignorant of the harm it would do. It would hurt far more than just OpenAI’s investors.",
"How much of a depression is a company doing this worth? This wouldn’t just risk investment in tech stocks (which a lot of retirement pension plans are currently relying on, which is the main vector of harm I’m talking about when I refer to blowing up investment capital), but a run on confidence in the US as a whole. 

If China is suddenly seen as completely owning both the future of tech as well as current manufacturing capability, it would seem like a safer place to store capital in spite of the authoritarian behavior that caused investors to flee China over the last couple of years. This would be EXTREMELY bad for everyone in the US, not just tech investors, who would probably be much better off than the rest of America. Americans have not had real problems the last couple of decades the way the rest of the (developing) world has, and now we think moral problems outweigh material ones. 

Your last statement is just vague hand waving. It isn’t guaranteed nor does it matter if AI would avoid such an outcome, the investment bubble collapsing would absolutely cause it.",

That dried up.  Now to keep making profit they need to reduce costs, optimize and reduce opex.  To do that, you need to cut cut cut.  Cut free food, cut health benefits, cut wages, etc...  but what you can't cut is profit and shareholder value / CEO returns.

"Yea it’s a weird subculture to say the least. 

I think they are all falling into the trap of information - they believe in the austere worldview that more information is better and that we should ignore all of humanity for the past few thousand years and go merely by this or that specific information I have.  

It’s often an extreme libertarian view with the additions of data driven concepts.  

Personally I do think more information is better and follow a worldview that we should go via information.  But I also think human systems intuitive understand certain concepts of organization and that democracy / freedom of input from many sources is most important.  

In the techno-libertarian worldview - we should steamroll society to mold it into what we feel our data says. Which is meaningless and dangerous - the data mostly comes from the disaggregated and free society and that’s how it’s most useful.  Once u corrupt the freedom of that information source it becomes hard to manage outcomes or have a working society. 

I almost feel this is a human form of the information problem that AI encounters - feed the same information in continuously and it will just disintegrate in its usefulness.  

I wish the tech bro culture could realize that the information system and it’s freedom are what’s really important and as much as any people begin actively working to corrupt that freedom (say by affecting major social media platforms / making their voice the loudest in the room / pontificating about forcing people to their worldview) they start to destroy the entirety of the information system",
That's what exclusively STEM education does to you.,
No they were always right wing.,
"Some offshoots of this is that 

(1) education is most important as you need the most disaggregated and best information processing systems amongst your society
(2) democracy is important to allow disaggregated information handling for decision purposes 
(3) free markets and anti-monopolies are another form of protecting economic information systems. Insomuch as more economic resources are consolidated to a few corporates - the information system breaks down 
(4) respecting differing views is important because group think or loudly overshadowing other view again destroys the information system
(5) utilizing psychological tactics to corrupt individuals thought processes becomes counter productive as it again removes freedom of thought and processing within that system. 

I often note that even a philosopher king would fail because once a system becomes too limited in information gathering and processing - it becomes harder and harder to manage chaotic systems. There isn’t enough freedom in the processing and gathering of information for society to operate optimally.",
"I don't think its that, I think its more that they haven't had any form of social interaction with a normal person in a decade plus",
Yes. Liberals are right wing.,
But it is definitely also that. They are so easily swayed by juvenile ideas that would have been addressed in humanities 101.,
"There is a point in that studying STEM exclusively cultivates a positivist and essentialist worldview that leaves little room for the ambiguity or subjectivity that are innate elements of our human condition, while the humanities excel at exploring and providing tools to negotiate these more nuanced aspects of existence.  It’s why the humanities are more equipped to cultivate empathy (And partially why they’re loathed and discredited by the right wing) because the humanities ask students to project themselves and their thinking onto other people’s lived experiences as a means of understanding this diverse existence - and that threatens any attempt to establish a singular hierarchical order. Thus we hear the hysteria that liberal arts departments in universities are indoctrinating a kind of “Cultural Marxism”; or “Wokism” but it’s really just people learning about other histories and being open and sympathetic to diversity; that the world has contexts. While STEM is reductionist in that it boils everything down to a solvable problem if we can only burrow down deep enough we can discover some kind universal “truth”.  We’ve done a great disservice to young people by ignoring the humanities imo. They’re equally important to a well rounded education.",
Why not both sir planck?,
Oddly when you look at the two extremes they’re both non-politically “conservative” in their own rational,
"Far right of both the MAGA and libertarian flavors are both right wing in that they seek to protect and entrench established hierarchies and dislike democratization.  Whether its government hierarchy or corporate hierarchy or gender role based family hierarchy, its the root of their philosophy.

To be left wing you have to want to democratize and flatten hierarchies.  Liberals are right wing because they like the hierarchies but think they can use enough band aids in the form of some public goods and investment and cycling of hierarchy leaders that hierarchies aren't a bad thing",
"Ah ok, so ""left wing"" has a specific definition, and that means ""right wing"" is *everyone else that doesn't perfectly fit that definition.* You're in, or you're *out*.

That explains the goddamn mess we're in right now, because Harris and Trump look identical to you.",
"No, i described the two definitions based on their original coining during the french revolution where the french left toppled the monarchy and attempted to democratize.  They are a spectrum whose understanding was developed by early industrial era political economists.  No, Kamala and Trump are not identical, but yes they can both be accurately described as right wing based on their defense of existing hierarchies and resistance to further democratization - they can both do that while having different policy preferences within the spectrum",
you can automatically discount anyones opinion as soon as they say liberals are right wing,

Also it's still spooky to me that no one is talking about the absolute certainty that the nsa has a model trained on their giant catalogue of intercepted internet communications, china, russia et al likely do too and none of the models are going to have any restrictions or morals. We know they copy all internet data, we know they have one of the largest super computers in the world, we know they have an almost unlimited hidden budget... it's easier than most people realize to train a good ai and all these stories highlight that so maybe we need to start wondering if we're getting such good free ones what is actually out there at the top levels?",

Truly crashing these stocks would be detrimental to the entire American economy. And China absolutely knows that and is twisting the knife trying to drain our value to establish itself as the dominant global power.

Americans have this sense of always being the most powerful, innovative, and influential country in the world because in all our lifetimes, we always have been. But we’re getting complacent and greedy and prioritizing company profits over genuine innovation, and now another country is genuinely innovating more than us.

Meanwhile, we’re all the most divided we’ve ever been, spending all our time and energy fighting each other and swindling consumers into paying every cent they possibly can for every product before they all start literally starving. We’ve pushed Capitalism to its limit and this is the result - a system where profits are the only thing that matters, and the appearance of innovation is more valuable than actual innovation.

now that these Chinese students are banned in US and the products are banned from sale. these top Chinese students started working for Chinese companies and were forced to innovate.

this was a tech war created by the US and the chicken are coming home to roost.",

Inevitable though is the further sanctions and hostile behaviour the west will have in reaction to this, which in my honest opinion would completely suck. In reality it could benefit everybody if they found away to work together.

"This isn’t true at all. The whole hubbub about DeepSeek is it bypassed the bloat in the cuda toolkit to use Nvidia’s PTX instruction set directly to more efficiently run than any other LLM on the market. Vastly reduced power costs and more efficient use of processing. So that approach made the big tech in the west look bad: They ignored this optimization, what else aren’t they bothering with?

I remember reading how the Chinese government has been trying to make their industry use locally sourced chips for years.

I'm surprised it didn't fall after Trump announced tariffs,
"The paradox doesnt inherantly have to do with energy consumption, its about generalized demand, where the cost of a resource being used dropping causes demand to increase. We've definitely see this with AI. Image generation was initially locked behind API calls with DALL-E. Release of open source models like Stable Diffusion made the practice far more common as people could run it on their own PCs. As more and more streamlined and distilled models reduced system requirments (especially VRAM counts) you saw it become even more common, to the point more websites could host them and eventually even be hosted locally on smartphones.

To be honest, JP wasn't exactly what I was getting at with that comment. Its moreso the actual optimizations made by Deepseek can also be applied to bigger models in the first place. So it's release could in the long term increase NVIDIA demand by both:

1) Letting more smaller groups host and train their own models.

2) Having big companies still building big models, now using what what they learned from R1.",

You’re getting downvoted but it is happening.

He’s not saying that he’s just pointing out the differences and deepseek didn’t come to these efficiencies because of lack of money it was that they didn’t have access to the more resource heavy chips due to the US chip ban,
"Alibaba has the same efficiency constraints that all Chinese companies do under the chip ban. You can’t throw money at nvidia when they won’t sell you the chips. But never underestimate human ingenuity.

"Honestly the only massive industrials in Europe in terms of modern technologies I can think of might be Saab and Rheinmetall for high-tech weapons, Airbus for aero manufacturing, SAP for global accounting software, Rockstar Games and Ubisoft (we'll see about that) for video gaming and ... maybe Siemens for basically everything medical, nuclear and energy sector?

I left cars out because I despise German car manufacturers (being German myself) and welcome them getting humbled.",
I am unsure why you think an economic downfall would be funny. Please elaborate how a tech sector crash would not affect you.,
"The island of Singapore? Directly connected via land to China? Yeah, easy smuggling through the single bridge to Malaysia and the *notoriously lax* customs inspections, then it’s just a hop skip and jump all the way up through Malaysia, through both Thailand and Laos, right to China! It’s so close you could walk those GPUs there!",
Well it is an authoritarian dictatorship so let’s not get carried away,
You’re right. I read too quickly. My apologies.,
Hold up you might be cooking,
Okay but what's this got to do with the sentiment that Chinese people generally put their country before themselves?,
I put nothing past any of the larger governments. MINE INCLUDED.,
"You should come out to the desert near the airbases where they test these new planes some time… you see all sorts of crazy crap.

It’s no surprise people used to think UFO’s were all over the dang place.",
I was saying people were saying it was equivalent and such but I was more referring to the Massive down hit NVIDIA took on what should be bullish news.,
The market has been closed there for the entire week.,
">customers pay more

This impacts demand which has an impact on their bottom line.",
or just throwing good money after bad it’s a bubble let it burst,
"Because they don’t really have any say. I’m sure they’ll prefer to be able to vote. Perhaps even for labour to have larger than a 40% cut of national income. In order to boost the domestic consumption & birth rates so sorely needed.

What matters is the party where those almost 4 million corrupt officials come from. They decide what China is in reality.",
"Unironically, good! Maybe something to reflect on when you're parroting US state dept talking points, tho.",
People still think UFO's are all over the place lol,
Ok? That has nothing to do with this thread though,
"We need the chips more than they need us? Doubt they move to the usa. Trump knows they won’t, too. I think the point is to cripple America as much as possible. He is a traitor",
AI bad hurrdurr,
Right so nothing then,
Da da deeep stateeee,
"Bro...

I'm an anarchist.",
They have fabs in the US already.,
"Sure, happy new year! Our government really appreciates the increased Chinese family offices  setting up here.",
So why are you believing and repeating US State Department propaganda?,
ur not an anarchist bro ur 15,
"What the Vatican peeps are saying is rational and reasonable, but the source did remind me of [Demon Seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Seed), a 1977 movie where an AI becomes evil and rapey at Julie Christie. At the time I thought it was Christie's attempt to out-weird Charlotte Rampling!",
Pot and kettle,
I thought oversight was God's department?,
Yeah I don't know. I'd rather closer oversight of those priests,
How many kids has AI molested? Just asking for clarity on who exactly is evil here.,
Electricity is devil. This energy should have been banned 100s years ago,
"Somebody's worried that the narrative will be taken away from them,lol. Ai will be in your pocket and you won't need to go to church for the answers. ",
"They should focus on this ""shadow"" where children are located in their own churches.",
Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.,
This thread should be great. Redditors vs Religion vs China vs America vs AI vs Billionaires ,
Just visualising the pope using ChatGPT,
"If AI acts up, we will make sure to send it to another parish far, where no one knows what it did.",
"Yeah you know what other organization has a shadow of evil, and needs some close oversight? Just take a guess.",
"It seems that religion really has their finger on the pulse on technology. Thankfully, they are the supreme expert in technological innovation, I one feel far better knowing that the pope is an AI expert and has our back. ",
Pot. Kettle.,
"AI does give “I have no mouth, and I must scream” by Harlan Ellison vibes",
"yeah, the Vatican happens to be right this time but we sure as shit don't need their fucking input on issues like that",
The priests’ cock shadow when they’re around little boys alone. The Vatican is probably scared of the data AI has compiled on all the sexual misdeeds under its roof. That’s a lot of data….,
Fuck off sky fairy wankers,
How much of AI does the Vatican understand?,
And they know evil well.,
Which episode of Black Mirror has all Religious Leaders replaced by AI that serve an Oligarchy?,
I know its debatable but I don't agree with you.,
They did build it on the theft of millions of humans labour… I think they have a commandment about that.,
"Interesting for the church to come out and say this at an opportune time for more regulation to protect western interests 😉

They would never side with a fascist regime to block development that loosens the grip of power from the very few to the masses of course. So, any comment during these times is purely coincidental /s",
we can make a movie similar to End of Days (arnold cast) where lucifer possess an AI and spill out demonic verses and mislead men into committing sins,
"AI is the Beast of Revelations.

Sara Conner warned us about this.",
History shows Vatican was always right...,

"This☝️

The shadow of evil is the roman church itself.",
They’re upset AI has taken their role of spreading disinformation based on actual information and twisting it to enrich themselves.,
He delegates,
they can both be evil,
"I guess the answer is obvious.

We'll put in as much oversight and enforcement into AI as they let us put into the churches(/government/whatever topic of choice is today).",
Wait until you read about how the books of the Bible were written and then selected in Wikipedia.,
what's the link between AI and church?,
"Oh shut the fuck up!

This is seriously tiring and completely misses the point that the problem the Church had was the cover-ups and moving clergy around, like how America moves cops around whenever they get too many complaints to avoid investigation.

This is just institutions protecting themselves from oversight and accountability, not because the Church had some unique issue with pedophilia than any other religious or irreligious and government or non-goverment organisations.

It also ignores the fact things changed and the Church clamped down hard on it since!

But sure, go on reddit, church-le-bad.",

"Pope Paul VI was certainly right about what widespread use of contraception would lead to:

* ""Marital infidelity and a general lowering of moral standards.”
* “\[Men\] may forget the reverence due to a woman, and, disregarding her physical and emotional equilibrium, reduce her to being a mere instrument for the satisfaction of his own desires.”
* “The danger of this power passing into the hands of those public authorities who care little for the precepts of the moral law…. Who will prevent public authorities from favoring those contraceptive methods which they consider more effective? Should they regard this as necessary, they may even impose their use on everyone.”",
Wotcha mean she's meeting Terry on Friday night 😂,
